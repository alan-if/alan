- BUGFIX: verb bodies in outer nested locations did not get executed
- Prohibited locating actors into containers
- BUGFIX: aggregating over things in restricted containers did not consider the
  class restriction so did not find e.g. attributes defined for that class

  name, so would find e.g. default syntax parameters
- BUGFIX: WinArun could try to restore from an empty file reference in some cases
- BUGFIX: If a multiple or omnipotent indicator was used for one syntax which shared
  a common prefix (starting with the same verb e.g.) would sometimes miss the

  (typically the ones scheduled After 0)
- BUGFIX: Checksum calculation to work with pre-alpha5 games

Changes in V3.0alpha5:
- Feature: nested locations, by locating locations in each other you
  can create nested scopes. You can even do this during run-time, perhaps
  a tool to create vehicles? Read more in the manual.
- Allowed more general expressions in Locate At statement and Isa expressions.
- Now generates an IFID as per The Babel Treaty.
- Rules are now also run immediately after the game is set-up.

- BUGFIX: added inherited reference attributes could sometimes cause a crash.
- A pronoun in player input, matching multiple parameters, now gives an
  error message.
- BUGFIX: An empty container clause terminated by a full stop would cause

- BUGFIX: Renaming the WinArun interpreter to a game name would crash on game
  save.
- BUGFIX: Negative integer literals would cause a system error
- BUGFIX: Full lists of multiply nested imported files would print incorrectly.

Changes in V3.0alpha4:
- Corrected scope handling so that locations are not always in scope.
- Made CANCEL accept expressions.

Changes in V3.0alpha3:
- Fixed a problem with multi-parameter syntaxes which allowed multiple
  parameters in positions which where not the last.
- RESTART did not clear the buffer so continued command could be executed
  as the first after a restart.
- Alpha interpreters will now warn if attempting to run games produced with
  beta or release compilers.
- Made WinArun set window title to game name even if the game was opened
  from the game open dialog.

Changes in V3.0alpha2:
- Fixed a problem with items in an opaque container being possible to
  manipulate using ALL.
- Fixed a problem with inherited reference attributes affecting proposed
  door class implementation. Now works as specified.
- Fixed position calculation with -ide (for use with AlanIDE) to be
  platform independent.
 
Changes in V3.0alpha1:
- Unified the automatic display of objects and actors so that they now
  both are listed in indefinite form. Actors are still listed separately
  since they might carry things and have script descriptions.
- Moved the special actor handling of automatic display to the library
- Changed the message identifiers SEE_OBJ_xxxx to SEE_xxxx
- Removed the message identifier SEE_ACTOR
- Adjusted default listing of containers without a description so that
  it always occurs unless the container is opaque.
- Added analysis of parameter references embedded in strings.
- Allowed expression in Step After <expression> (previously only allowed
  integer)
- Fixed a problem where you could not refer to the script of an actor, if
  the actor was a loop variable.
- Fixed inheritance of Initialize clause.

Changes in v3.0dev36:
- Printing of pronouns
- SET statement can now set a literal set value; Set x Of l To {}.
- SET statement can now set a set to the value of another set; Set set1 Of i1 To set2 Of i1.
- IN can now test set membership in set literal; If int Of i In {1,3,5,7} Then...
- Saving did not handle sets and strings correctly, could cause crashes, fixed
- Initialization of a set attribute to an empty set is allowed and possible in two ways:
    1) The attribute is inherited so the member type and class is known
    2) A single class identifier is given instead of members
- Integer loops; For Each i Between 1 And limit Of bridge Do ...
- Loops over Sets and Containers; For Each i In friends Of hero Do ...
- Aggregation over Sets and Containers; Count In friends Of hero
- Reference attributes can be initialized with a class instead of an instance if
  declared in a class. In this case all instances must give the attribute a value.
- Fixed WinArun startup so that it now prompts for a game name if the program is
  activated instead of activating a game.
- Fixed the renaming feature of the interpreter which was broken (if renamed the
  interpreter will look for game files with the corresponding name).
- Finally fixed the about box in WinArun to work in Win2000 and WinXP
- Debugger now knows on which lines it is possible to set breakpoints
- Added NEGATIVE ARTICLE/FORM for "Can't see any xyzzy here.", including a
  corresponding Say form and embedded printing symbol.
- Fixed a bug where a single trailing $ caused spurious output, now correctly
  outputs a single $
- Removed M_???_ARTICLE and M_PRONOUN messages since they are equivalent to the
  corresponding clause in the class 'entity' which now sets them as default. You
  can override them by adding the clauses with an Add statement instead of using MESSAGE.
- Fixed numerous bugs in the UNDO handling:
    o Now saves only states when player changes anything
    o Now handles strings and sets correctly
    o Now responds with "'<command>' undone." which is a new customizable message
- Added more separators (characters that automatically inhibit space and force
  capitalization)

Changes in v3.0.35 development:
- The DIRECTLY qualifier can now be used for all Where-type expressions
- A container using the default description will list its content
- The List statement can now operate on expressions, notably involving
  reference attributes
- Implemented text style hints which of course only works in some
  interpreters, notably non-trivial GLK-variants
- Exits can be inherited and added
- Initialize clause added to classes and instances, this makes it easier
  to control initializations locally
- Events can be referenced from attributes in the same way as instances
- NEW Play statement to play sounds, interpreter dependent support of course
- All media resources are now automatically packaged into a single resource
  file (blorb-format) by the compiler
- Improved word handling to enable more correct parsings when words are of
  multiple classes, e.g. verb&direction, adjective&verb and preposition&verb
- Nearby expression can test locations
- NEW Near expression which tests the adjacency between two instances
- Simplified the language grammar notation in the manaual


Changes in v3.0.34 development:
- Clean up of AT and IN. They are both now transitive/recursive.
  Optional qualifier, "Directly", can be used in expressions to get
  direct location or containment.
- Clean-up of pre-defined classes. Everything must inherit from some
  class. "entity" can not have location (invisible and everywhere),
  "thing" can but is not described automatically (invisible but
  localized). "actor" and "object" are described automatically
  (visible). Sub-classes to "entity" behave like "entity". This
  harmonizes with the fact that "literal" is a subclass of "entity".
- Names are now inherited by adding names down the hierarchy. This
  means that if a name is available for a more general class it will
  also be available for the more special classes and instances. Good
  candidates for use of this feature is fruit/apple/macintosh and
  human/person/man.
- Initial locations are inherited.
- Restrictions on auto-generated syntaxes now matches the class the
  verb was declared in.
- New statement "Random In" extracts a random element in a set or
  container.
- Pronoun declarations. Instead of the previously built in
  "IT"-handling and synonyms, it is now possible to declare pronouns
  for a class or instance. These words can be used in player input to
  refer to the instance if the instance was previously mentioned
  explicitly in the previous player command. (This also solves the
  problem with referring to a single instance using "them". "them" can
  still be used to refer to the same multiple set of instances as used
  in the previous command.)
- Improved use of correct case for words.
- Printing actor names are now done in the same way as for other
  instances wrt. to definite/indefinite forms.
- Parameters are available in the Message sections for many
  messages. This allows e.g. fixing the message wrt. to noun case (as
  in German, "any" = kein/keine/keiner depending on noun case).
- Changed default messages to use parameter handling in as many cases
  as possible, e.g. default location "content" listing, and container
  listings. It is now possible to re-format these into tabulation
  instead of the standard in-line form, for example.
- Added message for "unknown word".
- Interpreter now lists alternatives for ambiguous instance
  references, which of course can be tweaked using a new message.
- Deprecated "$include" in favour of a new, equilvalent, "import"
  statement. (***spoiler***) This makes future IDE-building easier.
- Verified that an inherited set or reference attribute retains the
  original type even if the infered type of a redefinition is not the
  same. A sub-class of the original is required.
- Fixed debug/trace output to show up also in winarun.
- Fixed command line arguments to winarun, you can now run the
  debugger, trace etc. also in GLK-variants of the interpreter.
- Fixed a bug which mixed up several syntax-declarations so that
  interpreter would respond with "You must supply a noun." for some
  legal inputs.
- Fixed a bug with spacing in command line version.
- Fixed a bug with opaque attribute not being inherited for inherited
  containers.
- Fixed a problem with some attributes not being saved and restored
  correctly.

Changes in v3.0.33 development:
- Changed DEPEND case separator from ':' to 'THEN'
- Added a new attribute type, set, declared using '{' and '}'
- Added a new interpretation of 'IN' which refers to sets
- Upgraded loop and aggregation filters to use 'IN' both for containers and sets
- Added messages for UNDO responses
- Added UNDO as a response to QUIT
- Empty player input is now interpreted as forfeiting that command turn

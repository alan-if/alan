Allowed multiple default attribute declarations.

Allowed string quotes within strings and single quotes within qouted
	ids (double them).

Renaming the interpreter makes it look for code and data files with
	the same basename.

A reversed file is loaded and reversed so .ACD files are now
	compatible across all platforms.

Character sets are converted automatically so national characters are
	also compatible across all platforms (as much as possible!).

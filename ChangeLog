Thu Feb 29 16:48:06 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Added an "-include" switch which allows multiple directories to
	be searched for included files

Wed Feb 28 17:32:04 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Fixed a small problem with reversing of game files on big-endian
	machines, the object article code was not reversed usually causing
	an "executing outside memory" error

Fri Jan 26 13:56:04 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Fixed problem with conversion of 2.5 games, when the same exit
        had multiple directions

Mon Nov 13 16:24:09 1995  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Added auto convert code for 2.5 games, the interpreter should
	now automagically convert games compiled with 2.5 and run them

Fri Nov 10 15:53:37 1995  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Introduced user definable messages. This caused introduction of
	a new reserved word: MESSAGE, which may cause some incompatibilities


Tue Sep 26 21:05:10 1995  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Removed the undefinite article from the default
	messages. Instead introduced the ARTICLE slot in objects which
	will be used (if present) before producing the MENTIONED message
	(which may be constructed automatically). If no article is
	declared a default is supplied ("a" if using english).

	This means that some tricks that have been used to somewhat remedy
	the article problem ('a' was always used!), don't work any
	more. Remove all 'a', 'an' etc. from the texts and names in the
	Alan source (usually in the MENTIONED slot and possibly in the
	HEADER for containers), and introduce the ARTICLE declaration on
	objects that require it (those whos name start with a vowel
	sound). For objects that doesn't need an article define an empty
	ARTICLE clause.

	It also means that their is now a new reserved word ARTICLE.

	It is also now possible to define the ARTICLE, MENTIONED and
	DESCRIPTION on objects in any order.

	* Scores were not cleared at restart


Fri May 13 10:36:25 1994  Thomas Nilsson  (thoni@rabbit)

Wed Dec  8 16:15:01 1993  Thomas Nilsson  (thoni@rabbit)

	* 2.5!

	* Allowed multiple default attribute declarations.

	* Allowed string quotes within strings and single quotes within
	qouted ids (double them).

	* Renaming the interpreter makes it look for code and data files
	with the same basename.

	* A reversed file is loaded and reversed so .ACD files are now
	compatible across all platforms.

	* Character sets are converted automatically so national
	characters are also compatible across all platforms (as much as
	possible!).

	* Added Restart question to the QUIT statement.

	* Allowed save to multiple files.

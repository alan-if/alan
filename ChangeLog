	* Made the hero a container actor. You can now use both the
	previous pre-defined "inventory" container and the hero as your
	inventory, they are the same.

	* Improved the analysis of multiple syntaxes fopr the same verb so
 	that it prints one message per occurance of the offending
 	syntaxes.

Wed Aug 27 12:12:05 1997  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Added the CONTAINS substring check expression

Thu Aug 14 15:35:24 1997  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Added the BETWEEN expression

Tue Jul 29 20:01:53 MET DST 1997

	* v2.7(5)

Mon Jul 28 10:45:33 MET DST 1997

	* v2.7(4)

Fri Jul 25 16:51:20 1997  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Changed grammar slightly so that the clauses within locations,
 	objects and actors can be given in any order. This change makes
 	game source not completely backwards compatible as a game
 	compiling fine with 2.7(4) and above will not always compile with
 	2.7(3) and below (depending on if you use the free order or not).

Thu Jul 24 13:36:24 1997  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Fixed some problems with the same word as noun, adjective and
	verbs. It is now possible to say "plant the pot plant in the plant
	pot".

	* Changed some dump format in the compiler

Sat May 31 15:29:24 MET DST 1997

	* v2.7(3)

Sat May 31 14:25:03 1997  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Fixed the bug with named script not executing

Sat Mar 29 12:31:24 1997  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* V2.7 finished and tested!

Thu Dec 12 14:53:12 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Removed the directory part of the name of the log file created
 	when using the -l switch to the interpreter, meaning that log files
 	are always created in the user directory.

Thu Aug 29 19:34:09 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Added the more Alan-ish way to specify
        scripts, namely by name (old style, by numbers, are still
        supported, and mixing is allowed).

Wed Aug 28 09:00:58 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Made the MESSAGE construct accept general
	statements.  Unfortunately this also required the removal of the
	positive response checking in confirmation messages.  Note that
	*any* input is now considered a negative response (YES, I will
	look into changing this...)

	* SYSTEM CHANGE: Changed the QUIT statement to ask for RESTART,
        RESTORE or QUIT (like old time InfoCom games). The message QUIT
        can be used to change the contents of the question, but note that
        the RESTART, RESTORE and QUIT words are hardwired into the
        interpreter. The new QUIT function may cause some problems with
        earlier games (and gamers) because the player will probably answer
        the wrong thing when doing a quit (but let's hope if-players can
        read ;-)

	* LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Added a new statement RESTART to restart
 	the current game. It causes a prompt for confirmation (the new
 	REALLY message, which can be changed using the MESSAGE construct,
 	like all the standard messages).

	* DOCUMENTATION: Changed format of the grammar description, now
	using the more clear (?) <xyz> format for non-terminals.

	* SIGNIFICANT LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Reference to objects/actors
	not at the current location allowed! Another special indicator for
	parameters in the syntax construct has been added. In the same way
	as it has been possible to indicate that a parameter can be
	multiple, it is now possible to indicate that the parameter need
	*not* be present to be considered.  Disambiguation between
	multiple objects that matches the words given by the player is
	performed as before (with presence taking precedence). This allows
	much simpler handling of e.g. ASK JOE ABOUT BILL, because we need
	no longer use tricks to make BILL present.

Fri Jul 26 13:48:24 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* SIGNIFICANT LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Added general default
	attribute available for all Actors, Objects and Locations: DEFAULT
	ATTRIBUTES. Allows for example verbs like 'examine' to act on both
	actors and objects in a much better way.

Thu May 23 23:42:05 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Allowed arbitrary order between
        declaration of initial location and names on actors and objects

	* SIGNIFICANT LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Allowed multiple player names
        on actors and objects.

Tue May 21 13:39:39 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Allowed the previously completely reserved
 	words ARTICLE, MESSAGE, QUIT, SAVE and RESTORE to be used as
 	identifiers

Fri Apr 12 11:05:41 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* BUGFIX: Finally allowed "no" prefix for boolean options, as in
        "No Debug", note that the 2.6 version of the manual is wrong

	* BUGFIX: Fixed the unexisting FPU and article problems in the DOS
        port

Wed Apr  3 00:54:24 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@heffa>

	* INTERPRETER IMPROVEMENT: Added the ',' as an alternate
        conjunction in player input

Thu Mar  7 14:21:22 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* 2.6!

Thu Feb 29 16:48:06 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Added an "-include" switch which allows multiple directories to
	be searched for included files

Wed Feb 28 17:32:04 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Fixed a small problem with reversing of game files on big-endian
	machines, the object article code was not reversed usually causing
	an "executing outside memory" error

Fri Jan 26 13:56:04 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Fixed problem with conversion of 2.5 games, when the same exit
        had multiple directions

Mon Nov 13 16:24:09 1995  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Added auto convert code for 2.5 games, the interpreter should
	now automagically convert games compiled with 2.5 and run them

Fri Nov 10 15:53:37 1995  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Introduced user definable messages. This caused introduction of
	a new reserved word: MESSAGE, which may cause some incompatibilities


Tue Sep 26 21:05:10 1995  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* Removed the undefinite article from the default
	messages. Instead introduced the ARTICLE slot in objects which
	will be used (if present) before producing the MENTIONED message
	(which may be constructed automatically). If no article is
	declared a default is supplied ("a" if using english).

	This means that some tricks that have been used to somewhat remedy
	the article problem ('a' was always used!), don't work any
	more. Remove all 'a', 'an' etc. from the texts and names in the
	Alan source (usually in the MENTIONED slot and possibly in the
	HEADER for containers), and introduce the ARTICLE declaration on
	objects that require it (those whos name start with a vowel
	sound). For objects that doesn't need an article define an empty
	ARTICLE clause.

	It also means that their is now a new reserved word ARTICLE.

	It is also now possible to define the ARTICLE, MENTIONED and
	DESCRIPTION on objects in any order.


Wed Sep  6 10:40:13 1995  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* 2.5(3)

	* Removed bulky GNU readline and added own readline
        implementation to suns&hp's


Fri Dec 16 17:42:48 1994  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* 2.5(2)!


Sun Sep 11 19:32:48 1994  Thomas Nilsson  (thoni@rabbit)

	* New (prettier?) icons on the Amiga

	* Added WINDOW-tooltype for arun on the Amiga

	* Added GNU-readline command line editing support on suns/hps


Wed Sep  7 15:53:16 1994  Thomas Nilsson  (thoni@rabbit)

	* Scores were not cleared at restart


Fri May 13 10:36:25 1994  Thomas Nilsson  (thoni@rabbit)

	* Corrected a bug in handling of rules

	* Improved handling of unbalanced quotes

	* References to default attributes did not work in some circumstances


Mon Jan 10 13:58:40 1994  Thomas Nilsson  (thoni@rabbit)

	* Fixed bug in compiler concerning check for comparisons of equal entities


Fri Jan  7 12:01:44 1994  Thomas Nilsson  (thoni@rabbit)

	* Added '-cc' to show compiler messages in old 'cc' style


Thu Dec 30 16:31:15 1993  Thomas Nilsson  (thoni@rabbit)

	* 2.5(1)

	* Fixed restart bug in interpreter


Wed Dec  8 16:15:01 1993  Thomas Nilsson  (thoni@rabbit)

	* 2.5!

	* Allowed multiple default attribute declarations.

	* Allowed string quotes within strings and single quotes within
	quoted ids (double them).

	* Renaming the interpreter makes it look for code and data files
	with the same basename.

	* A reversed file is loaded and reversed so .ACD files are now
	compatible across all platforms.

	* Character sets are converted automatically so national
	characters are also compatible across all platforms (as much as
	possible!).

	* Added Restart question to the QUIT statement.

	* Allowed save to multiple files.

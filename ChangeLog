	  the syntax node.

1997-09-15 09:08  thoni

	* MOdified the Element Lists to also contain an EOS element at the
	  end. This can hold the pointer back to the syntax which enabled

	  unkown
		  code (-1) it always got that.

		  the parser in the interpreter did only look for
	  conjuctions
		  when deciding on wheter this word (that could be both an
		  adjective and a noun) should be considered the last word
	  (and
		  therefore a noun and not an adjective).

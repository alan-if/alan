	* 2.5!

	* Allowed multiple default attribute declarations.

	* Allowed string quotes within strings and single quotes within
	qouted ids (double them).

	* Renaming the interpreter makes it look for code and data files
	with the same basename.

	* A reversed file is loaded and reversed so .ACD files are now
	compatible across all platforms.

	* Character sets are converted automatically so national
	characters are also compatible across all platforms (as much as
	possible!).

	* Added Restart question to the QUIT statement.

	* Allowed save to multiple files.

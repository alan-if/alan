To setup builds and packaging of Alan under a Jenkins account might be
a problem. Here are some tips:

WINDOWS:

- Install jenkins to run as a service under the system account
- Ensure the system account has some SSH keys that allow checkout
- The jenkins-build-job.xml and jenkins-upload-job.xml can be copied
  to two separate $JENKINS_HOME/jobs/.../config.xml
- Inno Setup is used to package into setup-files, but to sign you need
       - certificate (duh!)
       - signtool.exe from Microsoft, see this answer from Stackoverflow
                      (https://stackoverflow.com/a/52963704/204658)
       - the system account need to have configured the signtool
             (under Tools) to be something like:
                    <path_to_signtool> sign /f <path_to_certificate> /t http://timestamp.comodoca.com /p <password> $f

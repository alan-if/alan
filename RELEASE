This file attempts to describe the procedure for creating releases and
distributions of the Alan system.

"make release" (main development machine)

    This should always be done on the main development machine
    (ThoNi's) before its done on secondary platforms. It will check
    that the source files are checked in, and some other stuff. You
    can't do a release otherwise.

    It then goes on to build everything for release and run all tests.

    If that is successful, a tag (vXYZ) is set at the current HEAD in
    the main branch, and a branch for this OS is created at the same
    commit.

    Then all packages for the primary platform is uploaded to the Alan
    website.

    The file LASTRELEASE will contain the venum of the last
    released version on the current branch.

    Finally the venum should be upgraded (manually) and committed.

        vX.Y.(Z+1)

    On next compile that upcoming version is written to the file
    NEXTRELEASE so that other platforms can use that as version
    (versions should only be updated on the main development
    machine).

"make distribution" (secondary platforms)

    This should build all binaries, run all tests, and if succesful
    package them, and upload them to the web site.

Here are some quick reminders on how to set up for Alan development.

Cygwin:

        - install cygwin, ensure you have selected xemacs/emacs, cvs,
          gcc, mingw-runtime, gdb, make. I also use mintty as a
          replacement for the Windows Command window.

All:
        - CGreen: To run unit tests you also need Cgreen. You can
          install Cgreen from https://github.com/cgreen-devs/cgreen.
          Most Makefiles will try to determine if it is installed
          and build without it, but if you are modifying you really
          should use it!


Optional:
        - Emacs: I actually got GNU Emacs 24.x for Windows working with
          cygwin as its shell and command layer *and* c-xref, so now I'm
          using that. I found some hints on the net to setup Emacs

        - C-xref: to refactor C code in emacs I use the restored C/Java
          version originaly from xref-tech. You can find that at
          https://github.com/thoni56/c-xrefactory

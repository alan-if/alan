Here are some quick reminders on how to set up for Alan development.

Compilation:
    - you can build on most unix-like environments, cygwin, Linux,
      Msys2, MacOS/Darwin. To build the Windows binaries you need
      to need to have the cross-compilation tools.

Unittesting:
    - To run unit tests you also need Cgreen. You can
      install Cgreen from https://github.com/cgreen-devs/cgreen.
      Most Makefiles will try to determine if it is installed
      and build without it, but if you are modifying you really
      should use it!

Integration testing:
    - There is a special regression tool in ./bin, jregr. It is Java-based
      so you need a Java JRE. Then you can go to any of the test directories
      in the regression tree or compiler/testing and do `jregr`.

Optional:
    - Emacs: I actually got GNU Emacs 24.x for Windows working with
      cygwin as its shell and command layer *and* c-xref, so now I'm
      using that.

    - C-xref: to refactor C code in emacs I use the restored C/Java
      version originally from xref-tech. You can find that at
      https://github.com/thoni56/c-xrefactory.

Here are some quick reminders on how to set up for Alan development.

Cygwin:

        - install cygwin, ensure you have selected xemacs/emacs, cvs,
          gcc, mingw-runtime, gdb, make. I also use mintty as a
          replacement for the Windows Command window.

All:
        - CGreen: To run unit tests you also need Cgreen. You can
          install Cgreen from http://cgreen.sourceforge.net


Optional:
        - Emacs: I actually got GNU Emacs 24.x for Windows working with
          cygwin as its shell and command layer *and* xref, so now I'm
          using that. I found some hints on the net to setup Emacs

        - AnsiCon: I installed AnsiCon 1.24 which is a consol add on
          to make the XP and later console show ansi coloring (nice
          when running jregr), but I am unsure if it is required when
          using mintty.

        - Xref: to refactor C code in emacs I use the free C/Java
          version from xref-tech. Download it, build and install it
          according to the instructions there in. I compiled xref
          using -mno-cygwin and a minor change of 'sleep' to 'Sleep'
          (the Windows version). In this way it works on windows
          (e.g. under GNU-Emacs).

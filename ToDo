ToDo:

	* Think about punctuation! Can it be made optional?

	* Checks on containers to augment limits.

	* New clause in containers to use when extracting something
	out of the container.

	* More flexiblity in order of clauses, should be possible to
	be almost completely free.

	* Document how to create floating objects.

	* Change the interpreter to only look at its own name if no
	parameter was given.

	* The conversion programs does not work on little-endians like
	PCs since the words are then in written out in native format.

	* Think about a way to allow nouns to be capitalized, either
	automatic but preferably by author choice.

	* Confirm handling was trashed in 2.7. Any input is considered as
	non-affirmative. Need to change this so that a '(y)' can be used
	and input as affirmative.

	* The "plant pot plant in plant pot" problem

	* Actor-clash handling, i.e. what happens when an object is
	removed from an actor? How to specify if this is possible and what
	the actor does?

	* Actor conversation al a INFOCOM "floyd, get the card"

	* Procedures!

	* Conversion between 2.6 and 2.7 games (Not really needed)

	* Listing of saved games

	* The VERBDIR problem (check regression test verbdir), using the
	same word as both a verb and a direction does not work.

	* Multiclass word problem2: ADJECTIVE & VERB, doesn't work because
	the dictonary handling in the compiler gives the verb the code of
	the adjective, resulting in execution of the wrong (if any)
	verb... (See regression test adjverb)

	* Font sensitivity (esp. proportional fonts)

	* METAVERB, takes no tick

	* Potential problem: non-ISO sorting of dictionary

	* Verify $<n> w.r.t the syntax parameters

	* How to handle darkness and other global requirements on e.g. the
	location descriptions?

	* SCHEDULE <event> <where> WHEN <expr>.

	* ASK, CONFIRM statement?

	* SCENERY word, word, word.

	* BACKGROUND to display a background picture (where appropriate),
	I like the Zork Zero thing...

	* PLAY statement, to play sounds (for how long?)

	* SHOW statement, to show a picture (how to place it?)

	* SYNTAX look_up = 'look' 'up' (str) ['in' (lexikon)],
	i.e. optional parts of a syntax which can be given default parameters

	* EXIT ELSE ...

	* Status Line

	* New and better dictionary handling in the compiler could remedy
	the multiple word class problems

	* EXIT out TO RETURN ....

	* Check for 'locate hero'/'look' in DESCRIPTIONS (=> recursive look)

	* Replace printout of string attributes? Shouldn't they be
	surrounded by qoutes, as they are not indended as part of the
	descriptions but an attribute of an object, like the text written
	on a card.

	* SCORE & MAXSCORE as variables

	* > THE BALL, What do you want to do with the ball?, > KICK IT

Done:

	* Named scripts: SCRIPT <id>, USE <id> FOR actor

	* MESSAGE : STATEMENTS

	* Change QUIT message to "Really quit (n) ?"

	* QUIT-hanteringen

	* Presence check after syntax check?

	* If the HERO is redefined mulitple times it does not work well.

	* Clean up the manual with respect to the  MESSAGE-descriptions

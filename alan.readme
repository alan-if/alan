THE NEWS IN SHORT:

This is a development preview (v3.0.17dev) of Alan V3. It features
many new enhancements especially object orientation. This version is
Windows only, and you will require a Windows GLK.DLL to run the
interpreter.

This package contains the compiler, the interpreter, the manual,
the source for the Saviour game and a version of the standard library.

Changes from v3.0.16dev:
* the THIS expression is implemented and documented
* made use of WinGLK's file open dialogue
* a SAY now reacts the same way as old "$o", i.e. if it refers to a syntax
  parameter it will use the same words the player did
* refactored inheritance detection to be in the interpreter instead of
  statically in the compiler


THE LONG STORY:

The Alan System is one of the most easy-to-use tools to create
interactive fiction, aka. adventure games. The Alan System is based on
a special purpose computer language designed to be used by people more
interested in authoring and designing games than for computer
programmers. The system consists of a compiler which compiles Alan
source to a compact and portable form and an interpreter that
interprets such a form to allow playing of the game.

The Alan System is register-ware. To use Alan all you need to do is to
register. Registration can be done with a simple email to the Thomas
Nilsson (thomas.nilsson@progindus.se).

About the Alan distribution for Linux:

This distribution does not contain anything apart from the executable
compiler and interpreter. As of now there are only command line
versions available of them.

A recommended GUI to create new games is the AlanIDE, available from

	http://www.alanif.se.

There you also can find documentation, an extensive standard library
as well as some sample code.

This port was made on Ubuntu 11.04 in VirtualBox on a Win7 PC by
Thomas Nilsson (thomas@alanif.se).

About the Alan distribution for Mac OSX:

This distribution does not contain anything apart from the executable
compiler and interpreter. As of now there is only a command line
version available. A recommended GUI is teh AlanIDE, available from
http://www.alanif.se.

The port was made on a MAcOSX 10.3 G3 by Thomas Nilsson (thomas at
junovagen.se).

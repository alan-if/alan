    This script allow you to upload files to the Alan Home Pages download area
    from the command line. You need to have set up your ~/.ssh/config so that
    you can use "ssh/sftp alanif.se" to connect to alanif.se without using an
    interactive user or password. One way to do that is to ssh-copy-id to set
    up your remote ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.

    Since One.com disallowed plain ssh in their cheapest plan we are now using sftp.
    Along with that change it also became impossible to use ssh-copy-id. The current
    strategy is then to use sshpass (which you need to download/install) and it will
    use SSHPASS from the environment to login without an interactive prompt.

    If SSHPASS is not set, it will use sfp assuming you have set up your credentials
    as described above.

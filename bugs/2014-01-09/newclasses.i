-- ALAN Standard Library v1.10
-- Classes (file name: 'classes.i')


-- This library file defines various object and actor classes. 
-- Many of these classes are frequently  used in verb definitions in 'verbs.i' 
-- so they should be edited or removed with caution. However, to ease things up, 
-- it is mentioned at the beginning of every class below if and where the class
-- is cross-referenced in the other library files.


-- Contents:




-- 1. OBJECT CLASSES
-- ================= 



-- BACKGROUND
	-- Is present in the location but cannot be reached or taken.
	-- Doesn't appear automatically in room descriptions.
	-- A typical example of a background would be for example the sun, 
	-- or a mountain visible in the distance. 
	-- Compare this with 'scenery' below (a background object cannot be reached, 
	-- but a scenery object can.)


-- CLOTHING    
	-- Is a piece of clothing that behaves according to Alan Bampton's 'xwear.i' extension.
      -- The said extension has been fully assimilated to this library. 
      -- This extension prevents clothes from being worn in an illogical order, e.g. you 
	-- cannot put on a shirt if you are already wearing a jacket, and so forth.
	-- Also the verbs 'wear', 'remove' and 'undress' are defined here.


-- DEVICE  
	-- Is a  machine or an electronic device, for example a TV. Can be turned 
	-- (=switched) on and off if it is not broken.
	-- Attributes: 'on' and NOT 'on', NOT broken.
      -- Is described automatically as being either on or off when examined. 


-- DOOR 
	-- Can be opened, closed, locked and unlocked. 
	-- Is by default closed, not locked.
	-- Attributes: closeable, (NOT) closed, lockable, (NOT) locked.
	-- Is described automatically as being either open or closed when examined.


-- LIQUID 
	-- Can only be taken if it is in a container. You can fill something with it, 
	-- and you can pour it somewhere.
	-- A liquid is by default NOT drinkable.


-- LIGHTSOURCE 
	-- IS natural or NOT natural 
	-- (a natural lightsource is for example a match or a torch).
	-- Can be turned on and off, lighted and extinguished (= put out) if it 
      -- is not broken. A natural lightsource 
	-- cannot be turned on or off, it can only be lighted and extinguished (= put out).
	-- When examined, a lightsource is automatically supplied with a description of
	-- whether it is providing light or not.


-- LISTED_CONTAINER
	-- Is a special kind of container, the contents of which will be listed both after 
	-- 'look' (= in the room description), 'look in' and 'examine' (if the container is open). 
	-- (The contents of a normal container object are not listed after 'examine' but only 
	-- after 'look' (=room description) and 'look in').


-- SOUND 
	-- Can be listened to but not examined, searched, smelled or manipulated.
      -- Cannot initially be turned on or off, this has to be implemented manually by giving 
      -- the sound the 'switchable' attribute.


-- SUPPORTER 
	-- You can put things on this and you can stand on this. It is declared a container, 
	-- so you can take things from it, as well. When there's something on a supporter, 
      -- an automatic listing of it will appear in the room description and after 'examine'.


-- WEAPON  
	-- IS fireable (e.g. a cannon) or NOT fireable (e.g. a baseball bat).


-- WINDOW 
	-- Can be opened, closed, looked through and out of.
	-- Will be automatically described as being either open or closed when examined.



-- 2. ACTOR CLASSES
-- ================

-- the ACTORS are defined here to be NOT inanimate CONTAINERS (so that they can e.g.
-- receive and carry things. The 'contents' (= possessions) of an actor (except for the hero) 
-- are automatically listed after 'look' and 'examine'. (For the hero, the command 'inventory'
-- must be used.)
--
-- Actors are usually preceded by an article in-game:
-- e.g. "You see a man here."
--	  "There is nothing special about the dog."
-- unless they are declared as 'named'.
--
-- The following classes for actors are defined in this library:


-- PERSON 
	-- is able to talk (= 'CAN talk'). 


-- FEMALE
	-- a subclass of person (= is able to talk)
      -- can be referred to with the pronoun 'her'


-- MALE
	-- a subclass of person (= is able to talk)
      -- can be referred to with the pronoun 'him'





-- The contents end here.

EVERY background ISA OBJECT

	DESCRIPTION ""			
END EVERY.


-- A background object is present in the location but cannot be reached.
-- Note that a background object in ALAN3 is different from e.g. the backdrop in Inform7
-- in that a background object is at one location at a time only, unless
-- you use the nested locations feature in ALAN which makes the object available
-- in several locations. 
-- Here is an example where a ceiling lamp is located in the lobby, the bedroom 
-- and the living-room of a house, but not in other locations:


-- 1) First, define the area where the object(s) should be found: 

-- THE lamp_rooms ISA LOCATION   					
-- END THE.								

-- and then define which locations belong to that area:

-- THE lobby ISA LOCATION IN lamp_rooms
-- END THE.

-- THE bedroom ISA LOCATION IN lamp_rooms
-- END THE.

-- THE livingroom ISA LOCATION IN lamp_rooms
-- END THE.



-- 2) Then, place the background object in the area:

-- THE ceiling_lamp ISA BACKGROUND IN lamp_rooms
--	NAME ceiling lamp
-- END THE.


-- Now, the lamp is in scope in all of the above locations. (You'll have to include in the
-- location description manually though.)
 
-- Note that in this code you could define exits to other rooms of the house in the
-- normal way, without having to worry about the area at all, e.g.:

-- THE bedroom ISA LOCATION IN lamp_rooms
--	EXIT west TO upstairs_landing.
-- END THE.

-- THE upstairs_landing ISA LOCATION  
		-- ( = a location outside the defined area)
--	EXIT east TO bedroom.
-- END THE.

-- etc.

-- Naturally, you could also define a scenery object or a normal object to be
-- in several locations at once, in the same way. Note, however, that if you define 
-- a takeable object in this manner, it will disappear from the other locations once 
-- you take it in one location. Also, when manipulated (e.g. broken), the object
-- will be affected in all of the locations it is found.

-- INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE CLOTHING CLASS 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-- Here is a quick overview for using the class 'clothing'. 

-- A piece of clothing in your game code should look 
-- something similar to the following four examples:


-- THE jacket ISA CLOTHING AT lobby
-- 	IS topcover 32.
-- END THE.


-- use IN to refer to containers:

-- THE jeans ISA CLOTHING IN wardrobe		
--	IS botcover 16.					
-- END THE.


-- IN worn = worn by the player character (hero):

-- THE hat ISA CLOTHING IN worn  		 
--	IS headcover 2.
-- END THE.


-- worn by an NPC called Joe:

-- THE sweater ISA CLOTHING IN joe_worn   
	-- Don't declare clothing attributes for NPCs (unless the hero is meant to take 
	-- and wear the NPC's clothing).
	-- NPCs cannot wear clothing in layers!   			
-- END THE. 			
		

-- Define separate containers like the above
-- for clothes worn by non-player characters.
-- If you defined here 'IN joe', the clothing
-- would be listed in Joe's possessions:
-- "You see Joe here. Joe is carrying a book and 
-- a sweater." For a concrete example of how to do 
-- this, scroll down to the class 'actor'.
-- Note also that if the piece of clothing worn
-- by an NPC is not meant to be takeable by the
-- player character, you should declare the
-- the piece of clothing to be NOT takeable.


-- In defining a piece of clothing, you should
--
--  1) define it ISA CLOTHING (and not: ISA OBJECT)
--
--  2) give it one of five attributes 'headcover', 'topcover', botcover', 'footcover'
--  or 'handcover'; sometimes two of these are needed.
--  Which attribute(s) to use depends on the type of clothing; see the clothing table below.

--  3) A number 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 needs to be added after the above attribute.
--  You cannot decide the number yourself; look it up from the clothing table below.
--  If the value of an attribute for a piece of clothing is 0 in the table, don't mention 
--  this attribute in connection with your clothing object.


-- The above is enough; the rest is then handled automatically by the library.


-- The quick guide ends here. The clothing table follows right below. The text following the 
-- table gives more details about the principles and the use of this class. 


-- The clothing table
-----------------------


-- Here is the chart showing a selection of fairly typical clothing items and the values to 
-- set to obtain appropriate behaviour. Should you wish to create an article of clothing not
-- listed, usually a bit of lateral thought as to what it is most like and where it fits into 
-- the scheme of things will suggest a workable set of values, but be aware that you MUST use 
-- values in this chart, simply adding things with intermediate values is probably going to 
-- create nasty bugs:

-- Tips for using container objects:


-- 1)


-- The contents of a normal CONTAINER are not listed when examined
-- (you'll need to look *into* the object to see what it contains). 
-- If you wish to have the contents listed after 'examine' anyway, 
-- you should
--
-- instead of:
--
-- THE box ISA OBJECT
--   CONTAINER
-- ...
-- END THE.
--
-- do this:
--
-- THE box ISA LISTED_CONTAINER
-- ...
-- END THE.
--
-- Then, 'examine' lists the contents of the container.
--
-- The contents of a listed_container are also listed when the container 
-- is opened. This doesn't happen with normal containers.


-- 2)


-- For the command 'inventory' to list the contents of a container 
-- the hero is carrying, go to 'verbs.i', find the command 'inventory'
-- and list one by one all relevant containers that the hero might carry,
-- thus:
--
-- VERB inventory
-- 	DOES LIST hero.
--    ...
--		IF bag IN hero			
--			THEN LIST bag.
--		END IF.
--		
--		IF box IN hero
--			THEN LIST box.
--		END IF.
--    ...
-- END VERB.
--
--
-- If you leave out these additions, the bag and the box will be listed after the 
-- command 'inventory' in the following way:
-- 
-- "You are carrying a bag and a box."
-- 
-- only. But with the above additions, the outcome is e.g.
--
-- "You are carrying a bag and a box. The bag contains a loaf of bread. The box 
-- is empty."


-- 3)


-- To declare a container the contents of which should not be listed after 'look' 
-- or 'examine', declare it an 'opaque container' in the following way:


-- THE box ISA OBJECT
--   OPAQUE CONTAINER
-- ...
-- END THE.


-- or


-- THE box ISA LISTED_CONTAINER
--   OPAQUE CONTAINER
-- ...
-- END THE.


-- Objects in an opaque container cannot be seen or manipulated.
-- To change this, declare e.g.
--
-- MAKE box NOT OPAQUE.

-- General attributes
-- ==================

-- We define general attributes for every thing ( = object or actor): 


ADD TO EVERY THING

	IS examinable. 
	   inanimate.
	   movable.  
	   reachable. 		
		-- See also 'distant' below
	   takeable.

	HAS matching_key null_key.   		
		-- All lockable objects need a matching key to lock/unlock them.
		-- "null_key" is a default dummy that can be ignored.
	HAS text "".	

	NOT broken.
	NOT closeable.
	NOT closed.
	NOT distant.		
		-- Usage: you can e.g. talk to a "not reachable" actor but not to a "distant" one.
		-- You can also throw things to or at a not reachable target but not to a distant one.
		-- Default response for not reachable things: "The [thing] is out of your reach."
		-- Default response for distant things: "The [thing] is too far away."
	NOT drinkable. 
	NOT edible.
	NOT fireable.		
		-- can be used as a firearm
	NOT lockable.
	NOT locked.
	NOT readable.   
	NOT scenery.		
		-- Has special responses for 'examine' and 'take', behaves normally otherwise.
	NOT wearable.
	NOT writeable.

	CAN NOT talk.		


-- We still define that plural nouns are preceded by "some" (and not "a" or "an"):

	INDEFINITE ARTICLE
		IF THIS IS plural
			THEN "some"
			ELSE "a"
		END IF.

END ADD TO.	


-- If you need "an", you should declare it separately at the instance, e.g.:

-- THE owl ISA ACTOR
--  	AT woods
--  	INDEFINITE ARTICLE "an"
-- END THE.


-- (We add the 'plural' attribute to the 'entity' class, because the plural 
-- applies not only to things but also to e.g. parameters in syntax statements; ignore.)


ADD TO EVERY ENTITY
	IS NOT plural.
END ADD TO.


-- Some weight attributes for things:


ADD TO EVERY THING
	IS weight 0.
END ADD TO THING.


ADD TO EVERY ACTOR 
	IS weight 50. 
END ADD TO ACTOR. 


ADD TO EVERY OBJECT
	IS weight 5.
END ADD TO OBJECT. 



-- Common synonyms
-- ===============


-- Next, we declare synonyms for some words so that it will be possible
-- for the player to type commands such as both "put ball in box" and 
-- "put ball into box", etc:


SYNONYMS 

into, inside = 'in'.
onto = on.
thru = through.
using = 'with'.




-- Attributes for the my_game definition block
-- ===========================================

-- Here, we create a class, "definition_block", to group various definitions under.
-- In the game source file, the author should declare an instance 'my_game' which belongs
-- to this class.

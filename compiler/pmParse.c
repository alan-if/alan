 *    a. Find a continuation "u" of "x", such that "xu" is accepted.
 *    b. De composite "ty" into "qsy'", where q is a string.
 *    c. Delete "q".
 *    d. Insert u' (a prefix of u) between "x" and "sy'" giving xu' s y'.
 *
 * 2) Panic mode:
 *    If "q" contains a fiducial symbol "a"  then:
 *    a. Pop stack until "a" is accepted.
 *    b. If not succeeded resume at step 1.

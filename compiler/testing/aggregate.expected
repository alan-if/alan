  *1*   225 W : The COUNT aggregate will be applied to every instance
                (including locations, entities and instances of their
                subclasses). It is recommended to apply it to only instances of
                a particular class. Perhaps you mean 'COUNT Isa object'?

                type.
  *2*   226 E : Attributes cannot be used for filtering applied to instances of
                unknown class. Filter out instances of a particular class e.g.
                by adding a 'Isa <class>' filter.

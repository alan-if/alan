At the west end is a staircase, and to the south is the exit.You can not go in there, the door is closed.As you walk out through the door the large building collapses in a huge pile of bricks and stones.

It seem steady enough to walk in, but be careful if you are going to use it. There is a passage leading up, and another leading down into a dark cellar. To the east is the hallway. A strange smell emerges from below.In front of you is a dark cellar. To the west is a doorway into a dark room. The stairs lead up. A thin beam of light has found its way all the way down here.You can not go in there, the rats are too fierce. The hungry rats bite and tear at your legs as soon as you try to get past them.Silently sneaking past the sleeping rats, you enter the dark room to the west.In the light from the sun some rats can be seen.They are all sleeping.Watch it, you nearly lost your fingers trying to touch the hungry and biting rats. You must be more careful!The rats are awakened by your movements, and they are even more HUNGRY!!!Careful, you are only making them more angry!Kicking at them wakes them up, and now they are really HUNGRY!!This must be an old storage room. There seems to be any amount of old crap here. Keytops from ancient keyboards are scattered all over the place, and keyboard overlays can be seen laying around here and there. I guess they all came out of date long ago. There is also a shelf with old program listings. One of the binders is marked with 'DCM V7 891012'.On another shelf there is a spool of computer tape.On the floor a spool of computer tape can be seen.spool of computer tapeIt is already mounted.The tape is now securely mounted on the tape drive.There is nothing here to mount it on.The landing on the first floor is as dirty as all the others. Meters and meters of old cables are laying around, leading into a room to the east. The stairs leads up and down. They still seem alright. Through the dirty windows the barren field outside the building can be seen.Almost completely covered by dust, there is an old book laying on the floor here.The book looks as if it could fall apart any minute, but on the cover the three oval markings, also seen on the outside of the building, can barely be recognized. There is also something about 'Introduction' and 'Series'-something.As you carefully try to open the book it falls apart into dust and falls to the floor through your fingers.In front of you is a deserted office area. Desks and chairs are piled up in one corner. The ventilation system has partly fallen to the floor, tearing part of the ceiling down with it. Under the twisted tubing a couple of old coffee makers are crushed to pieces. One shelf, having some kind of lettering, no longer readable, is thrown to one side, and another is still standing in a corner, full of dust.There is a ladder laying on the floor here.A ladder is raised in the middle of the room, extending through the hole in the ceiling.3 metre long ladderIt is a wooden ladder with a few steps missing, but I'm sure it could be climbed.A small platinum plate reads: $i First manufactured by ThoNi in february 1985, $i as a farewell present to all the fellow workers $i at Ericsson with the least bit of imagination. $n$i Later reworked into the Alan Language and has $i since functioned as a test vehicle for that $i language.You are not strong enough to pull the long ladder up through the hole.There is nothing here to lean it against, so it falls flat to the ground.The ladder is already raised through the hole in the ceiling.The ladder is just long enough to reach up through the hole in the ceiling, where it now is standing.The ladder is too long to be raised in this room. It meets the ceiling before it can be raised completely, and slides down on the floor.You can't climb the ladder while you are carrying it, silly!Who have ever heard about someone trying to climb a ladder laying flat on the floor ?!?The steps of the ladder feels a bit weak, some more than others, but you manage to climb all the way without falling down.The second landing of the stairs is well kept through the ages. Some rust has gotten a grip on the fence but it is still rock steady. The window glass is still present in the frames, altough covered with dust so that the sunlight can barely be seen through them. There is a doorway to the east.This must be the old terminal room. Old and dusty, most of them cracked and broken, off-white computer terminals are standing on desks that once were called 'ergonomic'. Nowhere can any connections for the terminals be seen. A doorway to the west leads out to the stairs.One of the terminals seems in much better shape than the others.A worn old terminal is standing here.rather heavy computer terminalIt is a computer terminal, with a keyboard. It looks O.K.It's not connected anywhere.It is connected to the nearby computer.There is a message displayed on it.The message says: 'Please login. Enter USERID:'The message says: 'Enter command:'The screen is completely blank.OH! There was a coin under it!There is nothing here to connect it to!The computer notes the presence of the terminal and displays the message 'Please login. Enter USERID:'The terminal is now connected to the nearby computer.I can see nohere.The terminal is now connected to the nearby computer.You can not connect the terminal to theThere is a small coin here.It says '25 öre' and 'För Sverige i Tiden'.It is not possible to insert the $1 in the $2A clinking sound is heared from the machine and a candy bar falls out on the floor.On the wall here it says 'THIRD FLOOR'. The fence around the stairs is probably not to be trusted any longer and the stairs themselves are getting weaker. A puddle of water on the floor shows that the weather has free access through the empty window frames. A whissle by the wind is all that can be heared. Foremerly there was an entrance to the east which is now totally blocked.Even this high up the stairs are intact but the fence and railings are gone. Small pieces of glass and rusty metal covers the stairs that leads up and down. Be careful where you put your feet! There are doors to the east and to the north.In the middle of the room is a light spot on the floor. The light is comming from a hole in the ceiling. A strong wind can be felt comming through the hole. Bricks and stones covers the floor. The remains of bird nests can be seen, but there are no birds anywhere. Perhaps your entrance scared them off.You can't fly through the hole in the ceiling!Through the hole in the floor the end of a ladder is extending. Three of the walls in this room are missing and the wind is strong in your hair and clothes. Piles of bricks and wood are everywhere. Far, far below you the field surrounding the building can be seen.In one corner, near the remains of one of the walls, a crow has built it's nest.A crows nest is placed on the floor. I wonder how it got here?!As you turn the nest over for examination, a set of keys falls out. Otherwise there is nothing special about the nest.It looks like any other empty bird nest.A set of rusty keys are laying on the floor here.set of rusty keysThe keys are mounted on a ring. One of the keys looks like a door key, the other is even more rusty and broken.This must be the top of the top landing of the staircase. With a pounding heart and breath you look around and see two doorways. A small one to the south, and to the east a long corridor.The room is so small and low that you can't stand straight.In one of the walls an elaborate clockwork is mounted.It is in very good shape it seems.From the clock and through the wall a big spring is sticking out.The clock looks very complex, but there is a big handle for winding it.It looks broken, because through the wall a big spring is sticking out.A tiny little sign says 'Made in Korea'With a deafening BING BANG the clock begins to chime. From the corridor in the south a loud flapping of wings is heard.With a twanging sound a big spring chrashes through the wall and nearly hits you! I think you broke the clock.As you already have broken the clock, turning the handle yet again will not have any effect.A long east-west corridor extends in both directions. There are exits in both ends. In the ceiling there are markings from claws (BIG CLAWS!!) and the floor is covered with litter from bats.As soon as you try to move, a tremendous flapping of wings is heard. A giant horde of bats take you by their claws, and carry you out through the window. Your stomac turns inside out as you look down on the ground hundreds of feet below. Fortunately the bats gently put you down outside the building.$pThis looks like a small office.A small window lets some light in. The wallpaper has nearly all fallen to the floor and the chair is only a pile of broken sticks in one corner. Once the room had a balcony but I don't recommend using it now since the floor is gone. Anyway, it is not possible to get out there anymore.There is a drawer in the desk.It is open.The drawer is open.In it there is a technical manual.The drawer is already open.Pulling out the drawer a manual falls to the floor.The desk drawer is now open.The drawer is already closed.The drawer is now closed.Near the window there is a large desk.It is an old desk, made from oak. The top is completely covered by dustthat shows markings from fingers.where your fingers leave markings.The desk has one remaining drawer.The drawer is open.In it there is a technical manual.The drawer is already open.Pulling out the drawer a manual falls to the floor.The desk drawer is now open.The drawer is already closed.The drawer is now closed.There is a dirty technical manual here.dirty manualThe manual is dusty and the faded text is difficult to read.The text inside the manual reads:$i'You login by typing your Userid, and...' $i'... command is executed by typing it's name.' and $i'The INFO command lists available commands.' $pThe rest is unfortunately completely illegible. $pOOH! There is a hand written remark in the margin here, it says '$$NilGuSveGrOscSv$$'.$pFunny, isn't that what you tried earlier...A room of old computers, cables, disk drives, tape stations and floppy disks are spread out all over the floor. The exit is to the west.An ancient computer is standing in the centre of the room.It's powered up and running.The computer is mounted in a cabinet, about one metre high. The power cord leads to an outlet in the wall.Perhaps with luck it could be started.The twinkling front panel lights indicate that it is running.On the tape drive a tape is mounted.In the cabinet there is also an empty tape drive.A terminal is connected to the computer.There is an empty connection for a terminal or console on the front of the computer.Surprisingly, the old computer starts to whirr, the front panel lights begins to twinkle frantically, and the computer starts up.The connected terminal displays the message 'Please login. Enter USERID:'Careful, it may break!I'm sorry, but it is gone forever.The power cord is connected to the outlet and the power switch is on, but the computer still will not start. Perhaps this is not the way to get it running!This is the entrance to the old cafeteria. The kitchen and all the furniture is long gone, but there is still some paper boxes and old plates here.In one corner of the cafeteria there is a vending machine. It seems to be working. At least the little light inside is on, showing some candy.Most of the slots are empty, but there is some candy still in there. A slot for coins and a small sign is also mounted on the machine.The small sign on the machine says 'Insert coin'.On the floor there is a candy bar.The candy bar is some centimetres long and covered in brown paper.The candy is very old and the text on the paper is no longer readable.The candy bar tastes very old, mouldy and stale.The rats throw themselves at the candy devouring it furiously, nearly killing each other. When every little bit is gone they all fall asleep in the sunshine.You can't carry anything more.You are carryingYou are empty-handed.The robot is walking...$pWelcome to the game of SAVIOUR!$pIn this game your mission is to salvage the last copy of the famous ADVENTURE game.

Start At l.  "This test should show both an error for the second coin
      declaration but also an informational message for the
      first. However, there is no easy way to make jregr use -infos
      for just this test case so the expected output will only show
      the count of informational messages as 2 (No Adventure generated
      + Previous declaration)."

  *1*   331 E : Incompatible types in target and expression in SET statement.
  *2*   419 E : Target for SET statement can not be of boolean type.
  *3*   225 W : The SUM aggregate will be applied to every instance (including
                locations, things and instances without any inheritance). It is
                recommended to apply it to only instances of a particular
                class. Perhaps you mean 'SUM Isa object'?
  *4*   226 E : Attributes can not be used for filtering applied to all
                instances. Filter out instances of a particular class by adding
                a 'Isa <class>' filter.

-- 2)  I've always wondered about the programming environment you folks used.
-- What machines did you use to write a game on?  Something like a PDP or one of
-- the other "big" computers of the day, or did you actually do development on
-- machines like the Apple ][ or TRS-80?  Also, what did ZIL/ZIP (which is
-- correct?) code look like:  For example, if you wanted to code a room such
-- that:
-- 
-- 	1) the room's name was Gruble
-- 	2) the description was "this is a description"
-- 	3) north took you to room "Rumble"
-- 	4) west took you to room "Tumble"
-- 	5) if the user had foobared the barfoo then
-- 		5a)  Add to description "hole in south wall"
-- 		5b)  south leads to room "Arstol"
-- 	6) item "nabble" is here
-- 	7) item "krabble" is here, but can only be picked up if
-- 	   the player wasn't carrying item "frabble"

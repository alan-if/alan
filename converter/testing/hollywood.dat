Two days ago, while in Sammy's, the local drinking hole, your remember a dame handing you this card, asking for you to call back.

A soft spoken woman answers. After a few minutes of conversation, you discover that she wants to hire you to find her husband. You ask her to stop by the office. $n $nAfter waiting for about half an hour, Julie shows your potential client in. She appears to be in her early 30's, slender, tall , and with long black hair. She is wearing a tight fitting black dress, which shows off her hourglass figure. You ask her to sit down, and she gracefully moves into a nearby seat. $n $n She hands you a black and white photo. "That is my husband, the tall one with the mustache.", she says with an German accent. "Me and my Joseph came over to America as soon as the war ended. Four years ago he disappeared, no trace, nothing. I looked endlessly for him, to no avail. I just happened to run across this photo in a film magazine. It seems my Joseph has gotten himself some sort of job in Hollywood, in the movies." $n $n You nod knowingly. You have had plenty of cases of husbands leaving wives in the past. Some just get tired of their wives, some just want a new life. You explain that if you do manage to find him, he likely will not want to come back.$n $n "Perhaps", Thea says. "One thing though, before he left he didn't know I was pregnant. We now have a five year old son." "That does change things", you tell her. She hands you a few other doucuments relating to her husband, and a small bracelet. "This is all I can pay you for now, I don't have much money. After you find my husband, I'll get more for you." $n $n Normally you don't barter your services. However, being that both of you seem desparate, you agree. $n "I'll get back to you as soon as I find out anything." You see Thea out of the office.set of documentsThe documents date back before the war, all the way back to the early thirties. The print is in German, so you don't know what to make of it. The old man has translated a few paragraphs for you. There are some old pictures of Joesph Harbou, one next to some German Dame, a filmmaker of some sort, Leni Riefenstahl. From reading over the papers, it looks as if Harbou was involved with some Nazi propaganda films in the early thirties. Once the war started, he and his wife left the country and came to the United States. That's about all you can figure out from them.There is nothing else in them of any use to you.Please state who you sish to show them to.You hand the documents to the old man. "Well let's see here.", he mumbles out. "I know a bit of German, not a whole lot though.". He takes out a pen and starts scribbling away. After a few minutes he hands the papers back to you. "That's all I can translate, friend. Hope it is of some help.There is no need to do that.braceletIt is quite nice. Not sure of it's value, but it looks like it is worth something.Who do you wish to give it to?You hand the bracelet to the broker, hoping to get decent money for it.

It looks familiar, though.There is no need to show the photo at this moment.You ask Julie to take a look at the photo. She's always reading those movie magazines, maybe she knows the name of the film. $n $n "Let's see, it's one of those crime films. Not 'Crime city', hmm, I know, it's from 'The Postman always rings twice', with John Garfield. That's him in the foreground. Don't tell me you have Garfield as a client, bigshot." "No, no, just the fellow in the back, the one with the mustache.", you tell her. $n "No idea who he is, just some extra it looks like", Julie replies. $n You thank her for the help.

Can't quite remember the studio though.No one wants to look at you photo.half a quart of whiskyA quarter full bottle of whisky.A half full bottle of whisky.You have had enough to drink.You have another drink.

Even the murder of her husband. $n $n You decide to take action. You call your police buddy, Larry Kohler, to set up a meeting.

Just your ordinary, run down establishment. Maybe that's why you like it so much.stool1You are sitting at the bar. An old gentleman is serving drinks with a blank expression on his face. Sitting to your left is a young woman, face heavily made up, nursing a drink. $n $n You ask the bartender for a whisky, straight up. There is nothing like good whisky, unlike the rotgut you usually drink. After few shots you feel much better. You think over the case and come to the conclusion that a trip out to Independent Studios could spread a little light on the situation. You borrow a phone from the bartender and quickly call information for Independent's address. It's not that far away, and the way you drive (fast), it shouldn't take more than 45 minutes.You sit down on a nearby bar stool and order a drink. A whisky, straight up, just the way you like it. By your third drink Larry finally shows up. "Hey buddy, got any news for me?", Larry asks. You inform him about the entire case, and what has transpired during the last 24 hours. Larry looks very interested, and makes a quick call to the station. "I'll have a couple cops go out to Mr. Haswell's home. In the meantime, take it easy and keep your eyes open." As Larry gets up, you mention that perhaps you will take a quick ride out there. You follow behind the police to a large house. The police enter, then quickly leave. No luck, he isn't home. You don't give up so easilly, though. After the police drive away, you walk up to the house.

You look about, but it is too dark to see anything, so you leave.You open the door and enter the shed. You turn on your flashlight and look about. The shed is filled mostly with debris and garbage. You find a small can of oil, which you take. You also notice some old rags and empty gasoline cans sitting in the corner of the shed, however. Hmm, you wonder if Haswell used these to burn Cranston to death. You exit the shed, a bit more certain Haswell committed the murder.flashlightIt is an ordinary flashlight. It is rather small, but should still provide decent light.You would rather not waste the batteries at this time.hallwaygun caseIt is a glass case holding a small collection of fire arms.

Both Sarah Cooper and Frank Haswell are laid out with their throats slit wide open. Blood has soaked into the couch creating a dark red stain. You take a step back, trying to comprehend what has happened. Obviously Haswell did murder Sarah and himself, but then who...?The couch is soaked red from the dripping blood.You carefully move the dead bodies over, trying to find a good spot to sit. Unfortunately, the blood has soaked all over the couch and there does not appear to be a dry spot. Anyway, you would rather not sit next to dead bodies. They give you the creeps.bloodfrank haswellHe is dead as a doornail. You look through his jacket for clues, but do not find any.You do discover a small box of bullets in his pocket.

You try not to get too close, as if you fell in, it could be very dangerous.bushesYou carefully look about the bushes next to the pool. You think you spot something, and unfortunately your suspicions are confirmed. A man pops up from behind, holding a large knife. Just the sort of knife which slit the throats of Sarah Cooper and Frank Haswell. The man is horribly deformed, with scars are burns all over his face. At first you have trouble recognizing the man, but after a few seconds it comes to you. That is Samuel Cranston, or whatever he calls himself now. He must have escaped the fire, most likely set by Haswell, and is now seeking revenge. You are his next target. Cranston swings the knife across your chest, just missing you. You immediately pull out your trusty gun and aim at his chest. You get ready to shoot when Cranston leaps at you and slitsyour right arm. You pull your arm back and shoot, hitting him in the left leg. He leaps at you like some mad animal, knocking your gun away. You fall backwards, losing your balance and slipping over the side of the empty swimming pool. You hang on for dear life, with nothing but cement below you. your right arm. You pull your arm back and shoot, click, click ... How stupid! You forgot to load your gun! Cranston takes his knife and slowly slits your throat. You feel your blood ooze over your body, and you feel as though you are losing consciousness. The last thing you remember is Cranston standing over you with a wide smile on his face. Then you die.left legYou reach up with your hand and grab Cranston's left leg, directly where is was shot. He screams in agony, and tries to remove your hand. You pull harder, and his leg gives out. He falls over the side of the pool, smashing his head on the hard cement. Blood seeps out from his crushed skull, and he appears to be dead. $n $n You pull yourself up and onto firm ground. Looking down into the pool, you see what is left of Cranston. His body is a mangled clump, with his brains splattered on the cement below. The police must have heard your gunshot, as they arrive about five minutes later. Your buddy Larry, arrives with them. You explain what has happened, and your theory on the murders. After examining the scene, Larry says it all seems to check out. After a few days of recuperation, you decide to finish the case by seeing Thea. She has already heard the news, and actually made out pretty well on the deal. It seems since she was still the legal wife of Cranston, she is entitled to receive his full estate and savings, which is quite a sum. Thea is now a rich woman. She gives you a large payment for your services and thanks you enormously. It seems at least some good came out of this case, one which you will never forget...gatesI don't think the guard would allow that.wad of billsYou have ten dollars.Who do you wish to give it to?You hand the guard ten dollars, with the idea of gaining entrance to the studio. The guard looks at the money and for an instant you think he will throw you out. He glances about, and quickly waves you by. "Don't cause any problems, and be quick.", the guard advises.

Besides a small desk which your secretary is working at, there are a set of chairs against the far wall, and a file cabinet to your direct right. $n $n There are a couple of pictures hanging here, none of which are your landscapes. Julie decorated this room, and it actually looks a lot better than your own office.Your office is to the direct south. To the west is a open door.Your office is to the direct south. To the west is a closed door.You need to open your office door first.You walk into your office.You need to open the door first.You walk into the hallway.HallwayYou are standing in a hallway directly outside of your office. You have the only office on this floor of the building, which is a bit rundown. The wallpaper, which seems to be barely clinging to the walls is a dark grey, and the light grey carpet is quite worn. A set of stairs are to your south. The hallway continues to the north, and your office is to the east.You need to open your office door first.You walk into the office.You don't like leaving the building without your trusty gun.You walk over to the stairway.Hallway2You are standing in the hallway in front of a partially painted over window. It is sealed shut, although a slight breeze can be felt through a small crack near its' top. Through the window you can see the alley below. The only exit is to the south.StairwayYou are standing before a stairwell leading to the ground floor. Your office is to the north.StairsThe stairs lead down to the street level. You can hear the hustle and bustle of everyday life as the sounds of the outside world make their way into the building. Exits lead down and north. StreetYou are standing outside the building which houses your office. This area of town is generally quite busy, at least during business hours. A few people brush across you as they walk by in a hurry. $n $n Exits lead up to your office and east and west along the sidewalk.Sidewalk2You are standing before an old pawn shop. The barred windows protect the gathered riches of the poor and downtrodden of the neighborhood. Visible exits lead east and north.The store is currently closed.ShopYou are standing inside a pawn shop. It is cluttered with various goods. An old man, most likely the owner, is sitting behind the counter. SidewalkYou are standing in front of Harold's newstand, your favorite place to check out the local gossip. Harold is standing behind his stand reading a newspaper. $n $n The only exit is to the west.As you look about, you notice a large headline on one of the newspapers.You should check the newspaper headline before leaving, it could be important.BarYou are standing inside a dirty nightclub with the monicker, Sammy's. It is pretty quiet for the time of day. You spot one or two regulars sitting at the bar.You would rather not leave so soon.House4You are standing outside a posh two story house. The grounds appear well maintained, with a long row of neatly manicured shrubs located along the edge of the property. The porch is to the north, and a small gate is to your east.PorchYou are standing on the porch in front of a closed door. A large wicker chair is standing to your direct right. The only exit is to the south.You walk through the front door into the house.GateA small wooden gate is located here. To your south you can see a large back yard.The gate is currently open. Exits lead south and west.The gate is currently closed. The only exit is to the west.You can't, as the gate is closed.BackyardYou are standing in the backyard of the Haswell estate. It is quite large. A set of lawn furniture is visible to your left, and a row of shrubs is to your right. To the west is a patio and to the south is a tennis court. A closed gate is to your direct north.You look a bit foolish as you try to walk through the shrubs, as the branches tear at you clothes and scratch your face. You manage to make your way through one of the smaller shrubs when you come face to face with a large man holding a set of hedge trimmers. "Are you some kind of nut, the man exclaims. I have to fix that now!" You feel like an idiot walking through the Haswell's shrubs, and quickly try to think of something to tell the man. "I was looking for clues, you nervously sputter out. I'm an investigator working on a case for the Haswell's." The man looks at you oddly and says, "Well, I don't know what kind of clues you will find back here. Being an investigator you should have noticed you could have just walked around the shrubs instead of through them. Maybe you oughta go back to detective school or somethin'." He then goes back to his work cutting the shrubs, as you decide to walk around to the other side. CourtYou are standing on on a tennis court located behind the Haswell's house. The court appears to have been recently used, as a few tennis balls are lying about. The court seems to be in decent shape, except for a few small cracks located close to the net. Behind the court, to its direct right, is a small metal shed. The only exits are east and south.ShedYou are standing before a small metal shed. Overgrown weeds and bushes surround its sides. The rusted shed door is closed. The only exit is to the west.Inside_hallwayYou are standing in a small hallway. To your north is the livingroom. To the south is the porch and a staircase is to the east.LivingroomYou are standing in a large, well furnished living room. There are a set of sofas to your left, with a large coffee table directly in front of them. In the corner of the room is a glass case, holding a collection of guns. A large portrait is hanging above the fireplace. Across the room to your direct right is a partially closed window. The back door is located to the northeast. A staircase is located to the west. Other exits lead north and south.You climb out through the window onto the patio.You start to walk over to the back door, but hear someone walking about nearby. You spot a maid in the hallway, close to the door. You decide it would be safer not to approach this area.StaircaseYou are standing in front of a set of stairs. The livingroom is to the east, while a hallway leads north.You hear a servant walking about the hallway, so you turn back. You would hate to get thrown out.Hallway3You are standing at the top of the staircase. Exits lead north, and down.Hallway4You are standing in the hallway before two rooms opposite one another. Exits lead south, east and west.MaidroomYou are standing in what appears to be the maid's quarters. A small desk is standing to your direct left, and the bed is next to it. The room is sparcely furnished and decorated minimially. The only exit is to the west.DenYou are standing in the den. It appears to have been recently used, as several papers and articles are lying about on the desk. A leather chair is next to the desk, and a small sofa is across from it. It the corner of the room is a small statue of a Roman soldier. There are several paintings of landscapes hanging on the wall. The only exit is to the east.PatioYou are standing on a large patio. The back door to the house is currently closed. A small window is located here, and is open slightly. The only exit is to the east, leading to the backyard.EstateYou are standing outside a large house. The gardens and surrounding land are very well mantained. The front door is directly before you. Your car is parked here.You knock on the front door, with no response. You slowly turn the handle, and it is unlocked. As you enter the house you quickly notice that all the lights are off.Hallway1aYou are standing inside the house of Sarah Cooper. The lights are currently turned off, although since it is twilight outside, you can sort of make out where everything is. Exits lead north and south.You think you should take a look about the house before leaving.Dining_roomYou are standing in the dining room. There is a dining table set with fine china directly before you. A large fireplace is located directly behind the table. Exits lead north and South.Living_roomYou are standing in the living room. A love seat and coffee table are in front of you. A bookcase is to your direct right.A couch is sitting in the corner, and it appears that two people are sitting in it. It is quite dark, however, and you can't be sure.On the couch are sitting the dead bodies of Sarah Cooper and Frank Haswell. Their throats have both been slit, and their blood has soaked into the couch.To your east is a sliding glass door and the hallway is to the south.Back_patioYou are standing on the patio. The sun is setting and the sky is lit with a crimson haze. Lawn furniture is scattered about here, as though a fight took place. Drops of blood are smeared on the cement. A large pool is to your east and a glass door is to the west.PoolYou are standing before a large pool. It is presently empty, needing to be refilled. To your direct right are a set of bushes. You are not sure, but you think you see something moving behind them.PoolsideYou are hanging over the edge of a large, empty pool. Nothing but hard cement is below you. Standing directly above is the deformed Cranston, smiling gleefully. He is stepping on your left hand, causing you extreme pain. You have an immediate urge to let go, but doing so would mean falling. There are no visible exits.GuardboothYou are parked at the gates outside M-G-M. A small security booth is to your direct left. A tall, husky man is standing there, looking at you with a suspicous eye. "Can I help you, buddy?", the guard asks. The security gate is currently lowered, blocking further passage into the studio. The road back to your office is to your direct south.You decide to turn around and head back to the office. Perhaps it will give you some time to think of a way into the studio.LotYou are standing in front of a large administration building. You imagine the head honchos should be in there. Further to your east is another huge building. Your car is parked here.You tilt your head downwards and in you best "fake" voice ask to see Mr. Peterson. You explain that you are an important producer for Universal and have an appointment. She looks at you strangely for a moment, then nervously looks through an appointment book. As she does so, you quickly slip into Peterson's office. $n $n "What are you doing in here!", Peterson yells. Standing before you is Mr. Peterson, buck naked accept for a pair of boxer shorts. His "secretary", a young, well endowed blond, is lying on a nearby couch. As soon as she sees you, she frantically trys to cover her nude body (and a fine body it is). She quickly covers up and makes a mad dash out of the office. Peterson leaves the room for a second, holding his business suit. He arrives back in after a minuet or so, fully dressed. "Miss Stevens, I thought I told you no visitors!", Mr. Peterson bellows. The receptionist explains how you sneaked in wearing a disguise and she tried to stop you. Mr. Peterson quickly grabs the phone and states firmly that he is calling the police. He changes his tone once you tell him you are a private investigator. "My God, Stella must have caught on. Whatever, she's paying you to spy on me, I'll double it.", Peterson sputters out. You assume Stella is his wife and decide to play along. "Well maybe I won't have to make a report back to Stella, as long as you help me out here.", you try to say in a convincing manner. You walk over to the desk and inquire about Joseph Harbou. You take out the photo you have of him.$n $n "I don't know who Joseph Harbou is, but the man in the picture is Samuel Cranston, one of the big directors for Independent Studios. I remember he was in 'Postman' as an extra when he was just starting out. He's big now, married to Sarah Cooper." Mr. Peterson looks confused, as though he is trying to figure out what Cranston has to do with his girl chasing. You quickly thank him for his help before he gets too curious. Peterson nervously opens his wallet, and pulls out a few loose bills. "I only have a few bucks on me, but I can get more at the bank. What is Stella paying you, 200 hundred? 300?" You take a buck, figuring it will do for gas money coming out here. "No need, you've helped me enough", you tell him, and quickly leave the building. In the distance you hear Peterson yell out, "Remember, not a word to Stella.". $n $n Sarah Cooper, she's one of the biggest dames in Hollywood. She's a screen idol, and he's married to her. Something strange is going on here, and you plan to get to the bottom of it. A little lubricating oil for the brain is what you need, and Sammy's bar isn't too far from here.You have no need to go back in there.AdministrationThe inside of this building is as impressive as the outside. A large reception desk is located to your direct left. Portraits of the studio heads are hanging from the walls surrounding you, and a large bust of Louis B. Mayer is located on a pedistal to your direct right. The wall to your left is ordained with framed film posters, all hits from M-G-M. $n $n The floor is carpeted with deep plush and the walls are painted a solid white. The only visible exit is to the south.StationYou arrive at the studio in good time and manage to get an appointment with Frank Haswell, head of Independent Studios. Independent isn't as nearly elaborate as M-G-M, but it is still pretty big. They put out a few films a year, most of them with their star, Sarah Cooper. You are taken to a backstage studio and told to wait a few minutes. Mr. Haswell should see you shortly. It appears they are setting up a shot for a film they are working on. To your far right, a few extras are walking about. You spot Sarah Cooper in the far distance preparing for a scene. After waiting a few minutes, Mr. Haswell shows up. He is wearing a dark suit, apparently trying to hide his massive girth. He waddles over to you with a strange grin on his face, as though he is making fun of you. "Well, I hear you're a private eye. We did a couple of detective flicks a few years back. They did okay, no hits though." He rambles on for a few minutes, before you interrupt him with an inquiry about Frank Haswell. His face immediately loses that grin. "I don't know what you're getting at fella, but I don't like it. Frank is a good American. Just because he's a success, married to Sarah Cooper, all the lowlifes come showing up trying to make a fast buck. Well it won't work fella, not this time." He motions for a guard to escort you off the lot. You quickly show the documents and photo of Frank proving to Haswell that you have proof of his past marriage and his past life. His face turns white. He now tries a different tactic. "Look buddy, we don't want any trouble, right? It won't look good for the husband of Sarah Cooper to be both a bigamist and an ex-Nazi. How much do you want, how 'bout five grand?" Now that's more money than you ever seen at one time. You do have your morals though. You turn down the offer and leave the set. You decide to let him think a bit about information and get back to him later. You've basically solved the case for Thea, although you are not sure how she will react. You leave the studio and head for home. You stop at a nearby gas station, as you are running low.You are located at a gas station. An attendant is standing in the far distance talking with a customer. You are getting impatient.Walk1You are standing before a huge grey building. A few palm trees are planted along side its entrance. To your east is another guard booth, and to the west is the administration building.You would rather not risk anther encounter with a guard. You don't have any more money, for one thing...WardrobeYou are standing inside the warddrobe building. Hangers upon hangers of costumes, dresses and various clothes are located here. A few busy workers are scurrying about taking racks of clothes to different areas of the building. $n $nYou place the suit and other items back where you got them from.NowhereHeroPretty SecretaryYou raise your gun at Julie. Julie yells, "Hey, put that thing away. You never know when it could go off!". You oblige, apologizing for your stupid joke. It was a joke, wasn't it? It almost seems as though someone else was controling your actions...Julie wasn't fond of your attempt earlier. I wouldn't advise it again.You aren't carrying your gun.Julie is quite pretty and unfortunately a bit young for you. She has short blond hair and blue eyes. She is currently typing away."I already gave you my key. If you've lost that one you're in trouble.""Lost your key again? Here's my copy. Don't lose it again, or you'll be locked out forever.", Julie replies."You know everything you need to know about me, Jim.", Julie answers with a smile."You don't have any cases at the moment, something you should be used to by now.", Julie says with a smile."I don't know anything more about the photo.""Give it to me and let me take a good look at it.""I don't know anything about that."Old BrokerThe owner is an old man, probably about seventy. He is thin as a rail and has a shock of white hair. His suit hangs from his frame as though it was two sizes too big. The old man's face is wrinkled as a prune and his eyes are locked into a fixed gaze staring across the store, as though he his mentally cataloging every item within. "Can I help you Sir?, the old man asks. He has a slight European accent, although you can't exactly place it."What would you like to talk about, young man?", the owner asks."Well, let me take a look at 'em.""That's a nice look'n piece of jewerly. I'll offer you ten bucks for it.""I've owned this store for thirty years. Yep, me and this place go back a long time. Seen good times and bad. Take a look about. If there's anything you want here, just let me know.""I don't reckon I know anything important about that."HaroldYou raise your gun, as to shoot Harold. He backs up, a bit nervously, and stutters out, "Quick foolin' Jim.". You pull the trigger, click, click. The gun is not loaded. Thank God. Harold looks at you like you are crazy and says sarcastically, "Nice Joke." He goes about his work, although he seems to be watching you out in a careful manner. What made you do it? It almost seems as if someone else was controlling your actions. Ordering you about with commands...You already tried it once. Not again...Harold is standing next to the newsstand. He is an ordinary looking man, nothing special about him."What's going on?", you ask Harold. He simply answers, "Nothing much"."I know nothin' about nothin'.", Harold answers. Whatever that means.Samuel CranstonHe is not a pretty sight.You can't hit him and still hang on.Security Guard"I can't let you in unless you have a good reason.""I don't know anything about $o".ReceptionistShe appears to be in her early thirties, and had curly brown hair and a ruddish complexion.There doesn't seem to be much point in trying to talk to her. At least, not at this time.You express your interest in seeing someone in charge regarding a case you are working on. "Oh, you're in the police!", the receptionist says as her face lights up. She seems to lose interest when you tell her that you're just a private investigator. "Well, Mr. Peterson is busy at the moment sir. If you would like to make an appointment, perhaps you could see him at a later date." You thank her, but decline to make an appointment. You can't wait forever, you've got to see him today."I'm too busy right now to chat, sir."You can't do that.There is a young receptionist sitting here. "Can I help you, Sir?", she asks.Huh?I don't understand.I don't know what you mean by 'all'.I don't know what you mean by 'it'.I don't know what you mean by 'them'.You can't refer to multiple objects with '$v'.I can't guess what you want to $v.You must supply a noun.You must give an object after 'but'.You can only use 'but' after 'all'.That doesn't leave much to $v!I don't know which $1 you mean.I can't see any $1 here.You can't go that way.You can't do that.You can't $v the $1.There is nothing here that you can $v.There is$$, andhere.is here.Thecontains$$, and$$.Theis empty.You have scoredpoints out ofI don't know that word.<More>(again)Enter file name to save inThat file already exists, overwrite (RETURN confirms) ?

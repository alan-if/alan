       Independent isn't as nearly elaborate as M-G-M, but it is still
       pretty big. They put out a few films a year, most of them with their
       star, Sarah Cooper. You are taken to a backstage studio and told to
       wait a few minutes. Mr. Haswell should see you shortly. It appears
       they are setting up a shot for a film they are working on. To your
       far right, a few extras are walking about. You spot Sarah Cooper in
       the far distance preparing for a scene. After waiting a few minutes,
       Mr. Haswell shows up. He is wearing a dark suit, apparently trying to
       hide his massive girth. He waddles over to you with a strange grin on
       his face, as though he is making fun of you. ""Well, I hear you're a
       private eye. We did a couple of detective flicks a few years back.
       They did okay, no hits though."" He rambles on for a few minutes,
       before you interrupt him with an inquiry about Frank Haswell. His
       face immediately loses that grin. ""I don't know what you're getting
       at fella, but I don't like it. Frank is a good American. Just because
       he's a success, married to Sarah Cooper, all the lowlifes come
       showing up trying to make a fast buck. Well it won't work fella, not
       this time."" He motions for a guard to escort you off the lot. You
       quickly show the documents and photo of Frank proving to Haswell that
       you have proof of his past marriage and his past life. His face turns
       white. He now tries a different tactic. ""Look buddy, we don't want
       any trouble, right? It won't look good for the husband of Sarah
       Cooper to be both a bigamist and an ex-Nazi. How much do you want,
       how 'bout five grand?"" Now that's more money than you ever seen at
       one time. You do have your morals though. You turn down the offer and
       leave the set. You decide to let him think a bit about information
       and get back to him later. You've basically solved the case for Thea,
       although you are not sure how she will react. You leave the studio

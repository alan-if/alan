     camp here, on the beach hoping you would come and find him. $n $n You
     then proceed to tell him what happened to Dr. Evers and how he is a

     know I would never do anything to harm him."" ""Of course not."", you
     answer. $n $n You both start off looking for a way back to the time
     machine. The Professor had been working on several components to the

     back to the present time. You manage to follow a back way around the
     river back to the clearing where the time machine is located. The

     will return home. The machine begins to shake and you black out for a
     few seconds before you arrive back in the lab. The control panel begins

     linking Professor Adams to the murder. They take out a small test tube
     with a sample of dried blood. $n $n ""This is the blood of Dr. Evers.
     We found a small amount of dried blood in your sink. You tried to wash
     off the evidence of your crime, Professor, but it didn't work."", a
     burly police man states in a gruff voice. $n $n The Professor looks
     shocked, and says he has no idea where the blood came from. $n $n Just
     then, a teary eyed Clarisse walks up to the police and says she killed
     Dr. Evers. $n $n At first the Professor and the police think she is
     trying to take the blame for her father. However, she eventually
     convinces them of her guilt as she goes into her room and comes back
     with a small gun. She then describes the murder in detail. $n $n ""I
     sneaked into Dr. Evers lab to sabatoge his time travelling machine.
     After what he has done to father, I felt it wasn't fair if he received
     the government funding. As I was looking at his machine, Dr. Evers
     walked into the lab. He was surprised at first, and then he became
     furious. He said he was going to call the police and have me arrested.
     He also said that the government would now give him the funding, after
     this incident became public. I tried to escape, but he grabbed me,
     trying to push me to the ground. $n $n The gun accidently went off,
     killing him."" $n $n All of you are completely shocked as she tells her
     story. You can see how the Professor is hurt by this news. The police
     take Clarisse away, and you and the Professor follow to the police
     station. After a trial, Clarisse is sentenced to 15 years imprisonment
     for manslaughter. Her father is broken hearted and enters into a
     lethargic state. You wish you could do something to help them, as they
     are both close friends. If there was some way you could change what has

  " A Matter of Time $n $n An Introductory Adventure $n $n (C) 1995 Michael
   Zerbo $n Created using ALAN Version 2.5 $n $n You are a research
   physicist named Jonathan Stone. You are standing in the Professor's
   laboratory. It is the year 2150. You are about to embark on a great
   journey, a journey into the unknown. In front of you is the Professor's
   time machine. The control panel is apparently missing. However, the dials
   are locked on a specific date. A date seventy-five million years into the
   past. This will be your destination, searching for your mentor and
   friend... $n $n Your story began several days ago as Dr. Joseph Adams and
   Dr. Karl Evers, bitter rivals, were each working on their version of a
   machine which would travel in time. They were working towards a deadline
   for government funding. Only one would receive it, the other left out in
   the cold. You worked for Professor Adams as an assistant. His daughter
   Clarisse also helped out when she could. $n $n You knew Professor Adams
   was coming close to a breakthrough with his work, although you had no
   idea how close he was to actually creating a working time machine. $n $n
   This morning Dr. Evers was found dead in his laboratory, apparently
   murdered. Two bullet holes were found in his head. The police visited you
   a short while ago, requesting the presence of Dr. Adams for questioning.
   To your surprise he was nowhere to be found. The police automatically
   began a hunt for Dr. Adams, who became their prime suspect. Just now, as
   you carefully look over the Professor's laboratory do you discover where
   the Professor went... $n $n The time machine is missing... $n $n $n You
   begin a search for any information the Professor may have left behind. A
   small note sticking out from one of the Professor's notebooks, catches
   your eye. You quickly remove it. $n $n $n It reads as follows: $n $n I am
   going alone. It is too dangerous to risk other lives. I will attempt to
   go as far back as we had planned, to the brink of oblivion, when time
   began. I will search for what man has searched for his entire existance,
   the proof of God. I will return on the day you are reading this note. $n
   $n - Professor Adams $n $n You call Clarisse into the room and show her
   what you found. You both can not believe that the Professor was involved
   in the murder. It must be just a coincidence that the Professor tested
   his machine this morning. You did not think the machine was ready for
   use, but obviously you had been mistaken. $n $n Just then, with a flash
   of light, the time machine reappears in the laboratory. However, it is
   empty. You remember a safety device inside the machine which could be set
   to return it to the present time in case of a problem. Unfortunately,
   that is what must have happened. $n $n ""I am going after him"", you hear
   Clarisse saying. You know you will have to find him if he is still alive.
   However, you are not sure about bringing Clarisse along. Also, you know
   you must hurry."

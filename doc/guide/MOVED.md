# Alan Beginner's Guide

The files for the Alan Beginner's Guide have been moved to the Alan Docs project on [Github](https://github.com/alan-if/alan-docs/alanguide).

The Alan Docs project is an effort to collect all essential
documentation for the Alan Interactive Fiction System in a canonical location. The Beginner's Guide was written in 2006 by Mike Arnaud and is currently a bit dated. If you are interested in helping out updating it, please join the project.

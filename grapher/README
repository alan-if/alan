The AlanGrapher
===============

The AlanGrapher takes an Alan source and extracts information from it so that a graph of the map with locations and exits can be build.

It uses various utilities to work but should be packaged into a fairly usable package (.exe etc.). This is done using PyInstaller which creates a all-in-one executable except for one package, GraphViz.

You need to install Graphviz (from http://graphviz.org) somewhere, preferably in a folder without spaces in the names (on Windows C:/Graphviz would work). This directory must also be included in the system path so that any program will be able to find the executables therein.

One way to check this is to open a command window or terminal and type "dot -h". This should result in some output and not "No such command" or something.

Once this works you can just run AlanGrapher. It will prompt for a file. You can instruct it to ignore some locations from the Alan source. This can be handy to filter out "nowhere" and other non-important locations from the graph.

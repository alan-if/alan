General comments
----------------
I'm thinking of the standard library as remaining simple and general.
Stuff like handling light and darkness and other such things in
chapter six of manual could be added but then it would make using the
library much harder for beginners.

I like the split into separate files. It gives structure and helps an
author isolate their own customisation from the standard library. There
are disadvantages when trying to find particular items though. (Especially
for people like me without an editor that can open and search all the
separate files simultaneously.)

Perhaps some sort of index would be handy especially if the library
gets much bigger. Something documenting all the default attributes,verbs
etc in one list somewhere, eg:
-- OBJECT ATTRIBUTES
-- Closeable    -- Open.i
-- Open         -- Open.i
-- On           -- Turn.i

Especially useful for finding verbs like 'Put_...' which I'd have
sprayed all over library - mostly in put.i but put_down would be in take.i
coz its synonomous with 'drop' amd put_on in wear.i (as in "put on hat" as
opposed to put_on as in "put hat on hat-stand")

       

My Changes to 0.0(2)
--------------------
(Changes that I expect may be controversial have been marked with ***

I made some comments about things that I didn't change, the points that
are only comments have "(no change made)" at the end.)



std.i
-----
    - added filename and space for version info at top of each file (useful
    if concatenate all the files into one perhaps to print or global search)
    - list verbs in each file if not the in the file's name
    - added $include for read.i and put.i
    - added turn.i for switching things off and on
    - added new files talk, give.i (for NPC interaction)
    *** added new files attack, kiss.i (in most games I get frustrated enough
    to hit something or bored enough to kiss someone at some stage in a game.)
    *** I looked through standard.ala. I found verbs in there that I did
    NOT want to add to std.i. (no change made) But maybe they should be
    included :
            - wear/put on and remove/take off clothes (coz while its easy to
            do 'put on hat' its not so easy to program the need to put socks
            on before shoes etc)
            - play,play_with, pull
            - light, extinguish, put out (light source object)


take.i
------
    - concerned about 'can't take people' msg in case the actors aren't
    people (could be monsters, animals); can't think of anything good to
    replace it with though - just "You can only take objects."  (no change made) 
    - combined the pickup verbs with take as definition is the same
    - changed "u" to "up" in syntax of pick_up verbs to match the
    redefinition of direction words in nowhere.i
    ***added put down verbs as alternatives to drop, syntax definitions are
    in put.i with the other put verbs (a bit of an awkward arrangement)
    ***added take_from (from container object or actor)

open.i
------
    - is it necessary to have openable AND closeable attributes? I'm trying
    to think of something that could be one but not the other. I think you
    could just test the closeable attribute to see if something can be
    opened (no change made) 
    - same concern about assuming non-objects are people as take.i  (no change made) 
    - changed 'close' to 'open' in 2nd class-check msg for open_with syntax

lock.i
------
    - why have check obj here when its an Alan default check? I couldn't
    think why so I took the checks out
    ***added checks for whether the key was in inventory
    - added a DOES section to the _with verbs

throw.i
-------
    ***what is the UNLESS doing in these verbs, its commented out so I just
    removed them to be tidy

push.i
------
    - the verbs do nothing, maybe should have default "You push the $1"
    response even if the only reason is so newbie authors know something
    happened. I presume you're presuming that every push will need to
    be handled as a special case within an object or whatever.(no change made)

touch.i
-------
    - as with push, the verbs do nothing, maybe should have default
    "You touch the $1" response (no change made)

examine.i
---------
    - added x as synonym
    - added 'look at' as verb alternative for examine
    - added search synonym for examine, maybe should be separate but
    synonomous verb?
    ***disabled "examine all", ie:removed multiple indicator from examine
    and look_at

give.i
------
    - added this verb

turn.i
------
    - have created both "turn on" and "switch on" verbs rather than make
    switch a synonym for turn coz are likely to also have a "turn (obj)"
    verb where "turn" = "rotate"

help.i
------
    - added hint, credits verbs

nowhere.i
---------
    ***changed the directions to full words and the synonyms to
    abbreviations, a personal preference, mainly so verbs like
    pick up (obj) can be be defined as such rather than pick u (obj)


talk.i
------
    - new file with some basic ask/tell verbs (done quickly so its
    particularly ugly, sorry)


meta.i
------
    - added restart, again and undo verbs

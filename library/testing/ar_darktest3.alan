"First Lighted Location and Second Lighted Location are lighted. Dark
Location is dark unless someone brings a lightsource there. You don't
have a lightsource of your own but you can take a lightsource from
someone or give it to him. You can turn the flashlight on and off and
you can light or extinguish the match (even if there is no matchbox
coded).  You can call somebody to your location by ""call
(actor)"". You can send someone to the dark location by typing ""send
(actor)"". When Dark Location is lighted you will find a ball there."

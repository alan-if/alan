    NAME '[1;37;41mAT THE CAFETERIA DOOR[1;37;44m'
    DESCRIPTION
        "$p$iThe fledgling writer arrived at the front door of the Daemon College cafeteria. This is where the Buffalo Science Fiction Writers Action Group meets every other Wednesday evening at 7 o'clock in the evening. He had been there only once before and had not yet had his work examined by the group. He carried a manuscript in a folder under his arm. The last time he was at the BSFWAG he had given a copy to each of the other three members, fledgling writers all. Today he and one other member were due to have their manuscripts - and thus their very souls - criticized by the group. He was worried, and the door handle slipped when he pushed on it. 
$n$i""Dang!"" he said, and pushed again. The steel door wouldn't budge. He peered into the cafeteria, and it was clearly empty, dark, locked up. Probably vacated for intersession.
$n$i""They must have gone to the Duns Scotus building,"" he muttered.
$n$iSo what did he do?
$nA: Chicken out and run home. It's scary having people read your stuff.
$nB: He checked his campus MAP to find the Duns Scotus building.
$nC: He went to the Duns Scotus building and searched for the lobby (it's late, hurry!) Enter a direction (N,E,S,W)."

$p$iThree other members were there that night. He was greeted with cheers and salutations of welcome. He was just a tiny bit late.
$p$iHe muttered by way of apology: ""Almost got lost. Big parking lot."" 
$n$iHe sat down gratefully, and was horrified to find out he was to be the first to have his manuscript analyzed. He knew full well it probably would be smashed by the Hammer of Criticism on the Anvil of Despair. He had handed it out to the others two weeks ago, and they had been studying it, nailing down both the good and bad. He choked a little, then said: 
$p$nA: ""Gotta get some coffee.""

  NAME '[1;37;41mTHE BSFWAG INTRODUCED[1;37;44m'
  DESCRIPTION "$p$iOur hero's name is Rednaz, and he seated himself cautiously at the big table. The other three members of the BSFWAG were in various postures of readiness. O'Farragut leaned forward, shuffling through his copy of Rednaz's manuscript. O'Farragut was the most promising of the group, since he was Irish, and was on the fast track with his recent admission to an advanced program in writing at Luna University. Midgard fidgeted with the massive movie script in his monitor lizard-skin briefcase -- he was definitely linked to the star of Hollywood, and thus to wealth and fame. The ever-suave Gatsby leaned back, secure in his status of being the most experienced of the unpublished SF-four.
$p$iRednaz felt awed by their grandness and subtle mien, their savoir faire and otherworldliness. Someday, if he really worked hard....
$n$i""You ready, Rednaz?"" said Gatsby. He had marked up Rednaz's manuscript with lots of comments scribbled in red ink.

$n$iGatsby said, ""Yeah! I was really taken with it, but...""
$n$iO'Farragut said, ""Sure, it was a glorious story, but...""
$p$iRednaz felt faint. The manuscript grew into a forest of leaves, and the pages whirled with the damning wind of Literary Criticism. Rednaz's eyes turned up and the world dimmed...

DESCRIPTION "$p$iRednaz came slowly to his senses. The scene solidified into a landscape of weird beauty. The BSFWAG were there, enjoying his story, being washed with joyous frenzies, viewing sad desolation and piquant cameos, conversing with peoples of strange habits and incompassable dignity, pausing in soothing glades among friendly trees, tramping green vales crossed by happy brooks, then washed by tempests of emotion sweeping from the clouds, buffeted with tensions of great complexity and unusual color.
$n$iO'Farragut said, ""Sure and it's a beauty.""
$n$iGatsby said, ""I really like this!""
$n$iMidgard said, ""Fine story, Rednaz.""

$p$i But down from the hills came lurching and shambling five giant humpbacked monkeys. They had gnarly faces, hides of greenish brown, and their mouths sneered through long fangs.

$n$iMidgard said, ""That's right, Rednaz. They really surprize you, don't they?"" And he drew a gleaming black Uzi from his briefcase.

$n$iO'Farragut said, ""For Ireland, Kevin Barry and freedom!"" And he drew the Runic Sword of Ferteg!  

$n$iGatsby shouted, ""Your weapon, Rednaz! Hurry! The beasts are upon us!""

$p$iRednaz desperately cast about him, and found, amazingly, right behind him, a two-by-four with a huge nail through it. He hefted it, and it felt right!

$n$iThe powerful primitive primates, five of them, galloped forward and threw themselves at the valiant BSFWAG stalwarts.

$p$i What happened then?
$n$iA:The BSFWAG slew the monkeys, every one! Back to back, they battled ferociously until victory was theirs!

"$n$i""And I understand that it's easier to kill them each time,"" said Midgard, reloading his smoking Uzi." 

"$n$i""That's right,"" said Gatsby, who had more experience than any of them.

$n$i""Oh, no! That...oh, no!"" Rednaz covered his face with his hands.

$n$i""Blood relative, huh?"" said Gatsby. ""Sounds familiar, too. Parents and siblings are pretty self-centered. They are seldom really supportive of writers.""
$n$i""Check this,"" said Midgard, pointing at the back of one of the dead monkeys. ""What is on the back of this monkey?""

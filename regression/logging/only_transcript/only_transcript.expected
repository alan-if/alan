Welcome to this Alan V3 version of ADVENT. I came across the Alan v2
source for a conversion of ADVENT that Göran attempted many years ago. It
was performed from the original FORTRAN code but never completed. I ran
the code through the converter and with only two lines of manually
entered code, it ran. It is not winnable, but most of the things in the
original game works. Perhaps you can take a crawl and reminisce...

You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down
a gully.

west. There are openings to either side. Nearby, a wide stone staircase
leads downward. The hall is filled with wisps of white mist swaying to
and fro almost as if alive. A cold wind blows up the staircase. There is
a passage at the top of a dome behind you. Rough stone steps lead up the
dome.

Hall of mists (again)
There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.

> N
Hall of Mt. King
You are in the hall of the mountain king, with passages off in all
directions. A huge green fierce snake bars the way! Out from the shadows
behind you pounces a bearded pirate!
     "Har, har" he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it
away with me chest deep in the maze!".
 He snatches your treasure and vanishes into the gloom.

-- You asked for a more detailed bug report. . .here is a code fragment
-- of the problem with the CHECK command:
-- 
SYNTAX
-- |
-- |
  yes = yes.
  no = no.
-- 
-- |
-- |
-- 
VERB 'look'
  CHECK hero NOT AT yesno
    ELSE "Please answer the question."
  DOES
    LOOK.
END VERB.
-- 
-- |
-- |
-- (same with some other verbs like QUIT)
-- |
-- |
-- 
VERB yes DOES
  "I don't understand that!"
END VERB yes.

VERB no DOES
  "I don't understand that!"
END VERB no.

LOCATION yesno NAME 'Please answer yes or no'
HAS light.
  EXIT s, w, e, d, u, 'in', out TO yesno CHECK 1 = 2
    ELSE "Please answer the question."
  END EXIT.
  VERB yes
     CHECK 1 = 2
  ELSE
    EMPTY dumper IN inventory.
    IF general OF dumper = 1 THEN
      "Print instructions here."
      LOCATE hero AT end_of_road.
    END IF.
    "TESTING"
  END VERB.
END LOCATION.

-- (The CHECK 1 = 2 ELSE for the yes verb was an attempt to work around
-- the problem, but the compilation failed either way. The CHECK 1 = 2
-- ELSE for the EXIT verb is a way to keep the computer from printing
-- "Please answer yes or no." "Please answer the question." upon trying
-- to type a direction.)
-- 
-- Compiling:

-- ====>         1
-- 
--   *1*   103 E : 'EXIT' replaced by 'VERB'.
-- 
--  423.   START AT yesno.
-- ====>            1
-- 
--   *1*   311 E : Must refer to a Location.
-- 
-- 
-- 
--         208 W : 's' is not a VERB.
-- 
--         320 W : Word 's' belongs to multiple word classes.
--         999 I : No Adventure generated.
-- 
-- 
--         16 error(s).
--         8 warning(s).
--         5 informational message(s).
-- 
-- Now, change the location to be:
-- 
-- LOCATION yesno NAME 'Please answer yes or no'
-- HAS light.
--   EXIT s, w, e, d, u, 'in', out TO yesno CHECK 1 = 2
--     ELSE "Please answer the question."
--   END EXIT.
-- END LOCATION.
-- 
-- And it will work fine, with the exact same code.
-- 
-- In the same program, this is another bug with ARTICLE:
-- 
-- OBJECT food NAME tasty food AT inside_building
--     ARTICLE
--     DESCRIPTION
--         "$pThere is food here."
-- END OBJECT.
-- 
-- This part compiles fine, but when the food is picked up and an inventory
-- is taken you get a:
-- 
-- SYSTEM ERROR: Unknown instruction class.
-- 
-- Also, from your previous response. . .
-- >>
-- >> The Huh? message doesn't work at all. Pressing enter with no text
-- >> will get no response.
-- >>
-- >I think the `Huh?' is a leftover from earlier versions. Then the parser was
-- >redesigned and included a loop to just get a new input. Unfortunately the
-- >documentation (and the new MESSAGE construct) was not written to reflect this,
-- >the message should have been removed to. Do *you* think there is a point in
-- >keeping the `Huh?' functionality? If so, why? Just to get some other persons
-- >views on what is needed and what is just `featurism'...
-- 
-- I don't mind either way, just as long as the manual agrees with wha
-- happens. In this case, I was trying to create as authentic a port of
-- Adventure as possible, including what the reponse is if enter is pressed
-- with no text.
-- 
-- Something along the same lines but much more important is control
-- over QUIT. The "Do you want to restart (y)?" annoys me every time I
-- see it, since all I want to do is ask "Do you want to quit?" and
-- if the player types YES, quit. If the player wanted to restart, he/she
-- would very likely type RESTART instead of think "maybe the quit command
-- has the option of restarting." Plus, since I'm used to the "do you
-- want to quit?" I invariably hit YES half the time and restarted instead
-- of quitted.
-- 
-- While I'm being picky, a slight typo in the manual, section 3.4 (Synonyms).
-- The last sentence has "...that always will be replaced by the word on the
-- left in the player input." The word "left" should be "right".

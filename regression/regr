# Script for regression testing of Alan and Arun
#
# Where the STEAM regression testing utility isn't available this script
# can be used to run all or selected tests in a batch.
#
# Steam is configured to ignore lines that contain version numbering so
# those test cases that rely on debug mode (to have a repeatable
# randomizity(?)) will differ by having a line with the version number
# produced by the -d flag.
#
# Usage:
#	regression [ <cases>... ]
#
# After execution a list of all the differing cases is presented
#
if [ $# != 0 ] ; then

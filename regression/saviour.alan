-- This is a short game in Alan. It's got very little comments and is not
-- written as an example (in which case it would have been much better
-- documented ;-). Instead it was the first adventure game I ever wrote,
-- actually in Cobol as a farewell gift to my co-workers at a job I once
-- held. That company was producing Cobol-executing small business computers.
--
-- Well, in 1985 I went on to start at my current company, SoftLab, which as
-- a main area of competence has computer languages and development tools.
-- As a first experiment I implemented the IF language that Göran Forslund and
-- I had talked about for some time. That was Alan version 0. Since then
-- Alan has matured and is now in its v2.x:s. This game has been with us
-- since then and been ported from version to version of Alan.
--
-- No guarantees, of course, and it isn't as pretty as I would like, and it
-- does not show the real potential of Alan (but perhaps some of its elegance
-- can be glimpsed ;-) But due to popular demand I am now placing this at
--
--	ftp://ftp.gmd.de/pub/if-archive
--
-- Probably under programming/alan/examples (unless Volker Blasius
-- have a better suggestion)

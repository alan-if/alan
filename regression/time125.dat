It seems that rust had been holding the box together, as it seems to fall into pieces as the oily substance flows over it. There are some basic supplies here.

Several of the manual controls are not present, but the Professor should hopefully be able to fix them.

You nervously start the controls and hope for the best. Tha machine begins to shake and you notice a strange grinding sound eminating from the machine. You also notice that your field of view appears to be shrinking, and your vision is getting blurry. You close your eyes for a few seconds and after opening them you find yourself in a small clearing. You are still sitting inside the time machine. After regaining your composure you decide to have a look about.There appears to be a trail leading to the north and to the east. Towards the north it seems to be rocky and to the east you think you hear some type of river. You can see large tracks to the east. Other than this trail there seems to be no other exits. You are surrounded by forests. $n The time machine is located here.TrailYou are heading north on a trail leading to some hills and mountains. The view is very lovely. You look about the area, but you do not see any animal life nearby. You wonder where the Professor could be. If he took this path you would have noticed footprints. He could have wandered into the forest or took the other path. $n $n You can see a trail leading to a small opening in the trees.ForestYou are standing in the jungle. Little light is shining through the leaves and the air is very thick. A trail leads to the east and west.HillYou are standing in front of a large hill. There is a small cave within sight. You can see a path leading to the top of the hill. There is less plant life located here.HilltopYou are standing on top of the hill. You can see smoke in the far distance to your southeast. Since it doesn't appear cloudy you doubt lightning stuck and it doesn't seem a likely place for a brush fire. You think it may be the Professor. To the east is a small protruding piece of rock. You could get a better view if you could get on it. However, it does look a bit dangerous.LedgeYou try to carefully step on the piece of rock. It is a bit unstable. You can see much better from here and are almost positive it is a signal from the Professor. Too bad it won't do you much good. $n $n Just as you were trying to get back on safe ground the rock broke. You fell quite a distance. At least you died quickly...CaveYou are standing in a small, damp cave. To the east is a dark tunnel.It is too dark to safely travel in that direction.TunnelYou are standing in a small tunnel. The tunnel is quite short and ends abruptly. The ground is quite sticky with a strange mud-like substance. The only exit is to the west.DeadtunnelYou stumble around trying to see where you are going. Carefully you manage to step over the rock in front of you. Unfortunately, you hit your head on a large piece of rock overhead. You fall to the ground and die.RiverYou are standing on a dirt path. Directly before you is a waterfall that is moving very fast. At the bottom of the falls you can make out a river with a long coastline. $n $n There are also several large tracks to the north leading behind some trees and bushes. BushesYou follow the tracks to some nearby bushes. As you do so, you hear a strange sound from the other side. You can see the large head of a Tyranosaurus Rex peeking over the branches. Your scientific interest overcomes your fear as view this creature. He has slaughtered a small dinosaur and is in the process of devouring it. Exits lead north and south.RivercrossingYou take a large, flat piece of wood and try to go down the falls. As you head down the falls, you are certain you will drown. Miraculously you manage to hang onto the wood and stay afloat. You begin to float down the river when the large head of some sort of dinosaur starts to rise out of the water. You stand up on the piece of wood with the hope of diving into the water and escaping. Unfortunately, you do not make it as the creature slowly eats you.EatenYou watch as this fascinating creature walks toward you. You see his magnificent features clearly. You watch as this incredible creature swallows you whole...DrowningYou push the raft out onto the water and hope for the best. You quickly go over the falls, and as you do so, you feel the raft begin to break apart. You desparately cling to a large piece of wood, but it is of no avail. The current pulls you under, and you drown...LostYou travel down the falls on your raft. It holds together surprisingly well. The river takes you downstream farther than you had wished. You are not sure where the Professor could be, so you remain on the raft hoping to spot him on the shore. Unfortunately, by waiting so long, the raft begins to break up. You struggle to stay afloat, but it is of no use. You drown...ShoreYou travel down the falls on your raft. It holds together surprisingly well. The river takes you downstream farther than you had wished. Your raft is heading for a a number of dangerous rocks along the coastline. You dive off of your raft, just as it smashes into the rocks. Your possessions fall into the river. You manage to swim ashore, a moderate distance downstream. You look around the area as you walk several feet up the shore. It looks quite foreboding. It seems you can either follow the shoreline to the north, or go into the jungle to the east.You are standing at the shore. Exits lead north and east.Shore2You are standing on a clear shoreline. The white sand glistens as the waves slowly roll over its surface. Exits lead north and south.ShorelineYou are standing on the shoreline. There are several large dinosaurs walking about here. They appear to have some type of duck bill. A herd of these creatures are currently blocking your path. To the east is a dark path into the jungle. To the south is the shoreline.Win_gameYou drop the eggs close to the dinosaurs. The herd of dinosaurs quickly approach the eggs and begin to devour them. You make the most of this opportunity and quickly run past the creatures to the shoreline. You manage to get back on your path heading towards the fire. You walk until you are within close sight of the smoke. You think you spot a figure lying on the groundand you run to investigate. Several feet from the fire you see the Professor. He is lying on the ground, apparently hurt. He looks both surprised and happy when he sees you. $n $n "Thank God, you found me!", he exclaims. "I know I'm an old fool for trying this experiment. Clarisse must have been terribly worried." $n $n You look over the Professor to make sure he is okay. He has a few scrapes and bruises, but is generally in good shape. He tells you what happened, how the time machine malfunctioned and brought him to this time. As he was exploring the area, he got lost. He set up camp here, on the beach hoping you would come and find him. $n $n You then proceed to tell him what happened to Dr. Evers and how he is a suspect in the murder. He is shocked that Professor Evers was killed. $n $n "You know that Dr. Evers and I had our disagreements, but you know I would never do anything to harm him." "Of course not.", you answer. $n $n You both start off looking for a way back to the time machine. The Professor had been working on several components to the time machine, hoping to fix them. He says they may be able to take us back to the present time. You manage to follow a back way around the river back to the clearing where the time machine is located. The Professor installs the time components and you both sit down in the machine. As you start the controls you say a short prayer and hope you will return home. The machine begins to shake and you black out for a few seconds before you arrive back in the lab. The control panel begins to short circuit as you reach your destination. You see Clarisse running towards you with a wide smile on her face. She grabs her father and gives him a big hug. $n $n "I'm so glad you are okay!", she exclaims. $n $n As you exit the time machine, you hear someone in the next room walking towards the lab. Several policemen enter the room and proceed to arrest the Professor. They say they have found evidence linking Professor Adams to the murder. They take out a small test tube with a sample of dried blood. $n $n "This is the blood of Dr. Evers. We found a small amount of dried blood in your sink. You tried to wash off the evidence of your crime, Professor, but it didn't work.", a burly police man states in a gruff voice. $n $n The Professor looks shocked, and says he has no idea where the blood came from. $n $n Just then, a teary eyed Clarisse walks up to the police and says she killed Dr. Evers. $n $n At first the Professor and the police think she is trying to take the blame for her father. However, she eventually convinces them of her guilt as she goes into her room and comes back with a small gun. She then describes the murder in detail. $n $n "I sneaked into Dr. Evers lab to sabatoge his time travelling machine. After what he has done to father, I felt it wasn't fair if he received the government funding. As I was looking at his machine, Dr. Evers walked into the lab. He was surprised at first, and then he became furious. He said he was going to call the police and have me arrested. He also said that the government would now give him the funding, after this incident became public. I tried to escape, but he grabbed me, trying to push me to the ground. $n $n The gun accidently went off, killing him." $n $n All of you are completely shocked as she tells her story. You can see how the Professor is hurt by this news. The police take Clarisse away, and you and the Professor follow to the police station. After a trial, Clarisse is sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for manslaughter. Her father is broken hearted and enters into a lethargic state. You wish you could do something to help them, as they are both close friends. If there was some way you could change what has transpired. $n $n Then you remember. You do have a time machine. $n $n But that is another story... $n $n Congratulations, you have finished the game.Jungle4xThe jungle is quite dark and foreboding.

A Matter of Time $n $n An Introductory Adventure $n $n (C) 1995 Michael Zerbo $n Created using ALAN Version 2.5 $n $n You are a research physicist named Jonathan Stone. You are standing in the Professor's laboratory. It is the year 2150. You are about to embark on a great journey, a journey into the unknown. In front of you is the Professor's time machine. The control panel is apparently missing. However, the dials are locked on a specific date. A date seventy-five million years into the past. This will be your destination, searching for your mentor and friend... $n $n Your story began several days ago as Dr. Joseph Adams and Dr. Karl Evers, bitter rivals, were each working on their version of a machine which would travel in time. They were working towards a deadline for government funding. Only one would receive it, the other left out in the cold. You worked for Professor Adams as an assistant. His daughter Clarisse also helped out when she could. $n $n You knew Professor Adams was coming close to a breakthrough with his work, although you had no idea how close he was to actually creating a working time machine. $n $n This morning Dr. Evers was found dead in his laboratory, apparently murdered. Two bullet holes were found in his head. The police visited you a short while ago, requesting the presence of Dr. Adams for questioning. To your surprise he was nowhere to be found. The police automatically began a hunt for Dr. Adams, who became their prime suspect. Just now, as you carefully look over the Professor's laboratory do you discover where the Professor went... $n $n The time machine is missing... $n $n $n You begin a search for any information the Professor may have left behind. A small note sticking out from one of the Professor's notebooks, catches your eye. You quickly remove it. $n $n $n It reads as follows: $n $n I am going alone. It is too dangerous to risk other lives. I will attempt to go as far back as we had planned, to the brink of oblivion, when time began. I will search for what man has searched for his entire existance, the proof of God. I will return on the day you are reading this note. $n $n - Professor Adams $n $n You call Clarisse into the room and show her what you found. You both can not believe that the Professor was involved in the murder. It must be just a coincidence that the Professor tested his machine this morning. You did not think the machine was ready for use, but obviously you had been mistaken. $n $n Just then, with a flash of light, the time machine reappears in the laboratory. However, it is empty. You remember a safety device inside the machine which could be set to return it to the present time in case of a problem.

In this directory the repository-stored .a3c files are generated by older compilers
They can be re-compiled using the here stored (for convenience) Windows compilers
The source is in versions.alan and the resulting .a3c file moved to the correctly named one
NOTE that the alpha9 compiler output should be moved to pre3.0beta2.a3c

This directory is for testing backwards compatibility of the
interpreter between beta4 and beta5. In beta4 INDIRECTLY was
introduced to mean the default transitivity. This changed in beta5
when INDIRECTLY was changed to actually mean the complement to
DIRECLTY, i.e. not including what's DIRECTLY in.

Here we need to ensure that a beta4 compiled version of the
versions.alan exists. Do this with 'make'. The actual test will be to
run the development version of the interpreter on that to ensure that
it counts as beta4 was defined to do, namely include the DIRECTLY.

In this directory the backwards compatibilty of the compiler is tested
by running old interpeters on its output.

pre3.0beta should all load and run the games. New .a3c-files are
generated by the new compiler and run by the stored older compilers
for Windows and MacOSX.

3.0beta3 broke backwards compatibility because of attribute of
literals. So this directory does not use that feature, but includes
compatibility with beta2. The directory ../compiler includes literal
attributes but does not test for compatibility with beta2.

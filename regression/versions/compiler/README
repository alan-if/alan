pre3.0beta should all load and run the games. New .a3c-files are
generated by the new compiler and run by the stored older interpreters
for Windows. We tried to store MacOS binaries here also, to be able to
do these tests on more than one platform, but since Cygwin tries to
run programs without .exe this was a problem. (Perhaps we could

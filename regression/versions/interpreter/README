In this directory you 'll find .a3c files are generated by
older compilers: Here we can test the backwards compatibility of the
interpreter.  The .a3c-files can be re-compiled using the here stored
(for convenience) Windows compilers. The source is in versions.alan and
the resulting .a3c file moved to the correctly named one.

NOTE that the alpha9 compiler output should be moved to
pre3.0beta2.a3c

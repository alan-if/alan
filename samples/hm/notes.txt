The glasses needs the Pronoun them.


"ask Julie about thea/joseph/harbou" does not work. "I don't know the word..."

"enter pawn shop" does not work. Or maybe this is because I run Gargoyle (alpha1?)? No WinArun alpha4 also has problems.

Perhaps "outside the pawn shop" should be more specific about the pawn shop being to the north.

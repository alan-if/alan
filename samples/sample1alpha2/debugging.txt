Ok, Anssis problem was that running the sample1.rec (recorded
commands) would not take the white key with the final command.

I have found out that this is caused by the Check on line 325 which
seems to cause the possible() check to fail since that builds a list
of all checks and tries them to remove all impossible choices.

However this should not occur since it is completely possible to take
the white key as a separate command.
